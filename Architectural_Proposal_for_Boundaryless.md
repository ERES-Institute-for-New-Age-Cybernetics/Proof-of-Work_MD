Architectural Proposal for Boundaryless Networks  September 17, 2003 

**A Knowledge Grid** \
Coordinated Public & Private Network 

**Abstract**.  The  CyberRAVE   (CR)  proposed  interpersonal  interactions   architecture  (boundaryless design)  illustrates  an  open   approach  to  future  IP  network  development  among  public  and  private Communities-of-Interest (COI). While the design protects existing technology investment, it establishes a new  ROI  metric  for  network  security  and  business  intelligence.  It  defines  an  integrated  solution  for technical and social issues, while establishing methodology for  change management , motivational factors for implementation, and a plan for user adoption. The design addresses chief concerns associated with data security,  user  privacy,  and  decision  support.  The  design  establishes  a  developer  platform  involving Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies, and an illustration for scalability among all primary vertical markets. The design describes a strategy for unifying public and private interests with standards-based metadata ontologies and semantic metadata packet encapsulation. Furthermore, CR offers an outlook for reduced implementation costs that facilitate broad-based deployment by groups of all size.   

**Motivation**.  Private  industry  is  reluctant  to  report  security  breaches,  or  share  information  that  may illuminate any network vulnerability. They are resistant to regulation that can impose new costs and restrictions over their current infrastructure or business processes. Public interests are under increasing pressure to establish Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)  best-practices, methods, and technologies that safeguard national resources, while identifying and communicating threats and opportunities relative to specific sectors within the economy. Return on network security investment, and privacy concerns remain  principal conditions preventing cooperation between these two interests.  

**RAVE Description**. A RAVE uses open-source data  wrapper  technology to disguise, encrypt, and cloak user data. Aggregated data flows are indexed within a cognitive meta data directory. The directory provides a contextual resource for knowledge discovery, and supports tools that enable specific business, analytic, and risk management goals. A RAVE converts structured data into a product that serves the interest of an individual, group, enterprise, or community. Structured RAVE data can be commoditized by assigning relevancy  values, and used for decision support.  Real-time decision support facilitates: 

Ø Increased business efficiencies 

Ø Support for regulatory compliance  

Ø Protected privacy rights 

Ø Maximized data services risk management benefits  

Ø Protection of sensitive information and intellectual property 

Ø Coordinated public and private information sharing and analysis  

Ø Quantifiable  efficiencies  associated  with  business  process,  customer  behavior,  competitor 

behavior, and community (market) environment 

Ø Minimizes the complexity of selecting, standardizing, and measuring data usefulness  Ø Establishes a defense-in-depth high level of network security 

Ø Business Intelligence metric for Security ROI 

Ø Aggregated price structure 

Ø Pay-as-you-go shared usage model 

**Advisory Groups**. Each RAVE is governed by a Vertical Community Advisory Group (VCAG). VCAG Directors are democratically elected to represent the interests of a vertical market segment (e.g. banking, healthcare, insurance etc). VCAG Directors are luminaries from within industry, institutions, governments, ISACs  and  related  associations.  VCAG  Directors  fully  understand  market  conditions,  and  can  fairly represent the interests of their respective community. VCAG data management policies support defined community objectives, and help determine  fair use  laws for RAVE data brokering services; including collection, contextualization, and visualization of  semantically rich  data.  

**Knowledge Grid**. Information that exists in email, calendars, task assignments, reports, manuals, process guides,  blogs,  news  feeds,  digital  libraries  and  archives  etc  can  help  fuel  knowledge  discovery.  A  knowledge grid  provides a communications infrastructure supported by user communities, investigative and diagnostic tools (see figure 1).

**Data Management**. A RAVE establishes a transparent customer-driven platform for applied research tools, intelligent agents, and data analytics, while enabling predictive modeling with clear, natural language descriptions of potential threats and opportunities. RAVE open-source packet inspection and referencing methods  establish  a  real-time registry of relevant network resources. RAVE advanced data brokering services  include  support  for  Authentication,  Authorization,  and  Accounting  (AAA)  control.  Proposed RAVE open source technologies will enable data security, predictive modeling, intelligent agents, and resource discovery for Users and Groups within a secure online community Virtual Private Network (VPN) grid. The RAVE platform works in conjunction with existing technology investments, and supports  open standards  for transparent operation and developer participation. 

**Open Network Solution**. CR proposes the use of semantic metadata as an aid to defining threats and opportunities associated with COI data security, business intelligence, and User privacy (see  figure 2).

The CR proposed open network solution considers the convergence of these principal areas of interest in conjunction with Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) data packet description and translation functions. The CR solution involves VCAG policy definition and controls that establish the basis for industry-specific online democracies.  

Prior to the distribution of outgoing RAVE data, information is structured using semantic markup language (e.g.  XML,  SAML).  A  VCAG  defined  semantic  mediation  process  interprets  the  encapsulated  data taxonomy including syntactic and semantic ontological profiles before indexing User and Group data flows (e.g. subject, verb, context, and administrative policy). The foundation for RAVE encapsulation can be found within the OSI structure at the layer 5 (security) level, and describes the User and Group in terms of their respective security policies. Well-formed data is interpreted within a semantic mediation process that attaches  a  VCAG  profile  at  the  layer  6  (syntax)  level.  And,  a  profile  interpretation  is  given  for  the definition of  actionable intelligence  at the layer 7 (semantics) level based upon User and Group, and VCAG policy description. OSI/TCP translation will transfer the described contents to level 4, within the  reserved space  partition.  

**Business Solutions**. Intelligence is assimilated via aggregated network data traffic flows from RAVE Users and  Groups.  CR  establishes  business  intelligence,  supply  chain  efficiencies,  threats  and  opportunities assessment, and regulatory compliance by monitoring the flow of network information in a controlled VPN grid  environment.  CR  increases  data  privacy  with  an  open-source  packet  wrapper   technology  that examines,  contextualizes,  and  indexes  the  contents  of  User  and  Group  data  packets  based  upon acknowledged policies.  

**Technology Integration**. To facilitate User and Group integration into the RAVE, CR proposes VCAG Director  participation  among  Force  Multiplier   customers,  in  conjunction  with  broad-based  reseller arrangements. Force Multipliers should posses significant market influence, internal resources, and the desire to meet the ever-increasing demands associated with business intelligence, network security, and regulatory compliance. CR  Charter Member  Directors serve as the basis for the initial community VCAG, and will help define policy development and enforcement best practices.  

**CR Value Add**. CR portal development will support semantic keyword domain names, sub-domains, and file name extensions. CR registered and maintained library of well-formed, semantically structured generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) are industry-specific, and aimed towards private and secure communications (see  http://vpn.cyberrave.com).  CR  domains  form  a  semantic  foundation  that  establishes  contextual relevancy for RAVE metadata with properly formed namespace. Stateful inspection of contextual data flows are logged into the RAVE meta directory, creating a reference structure (catalogue) where analytical tools can reference, and interpret data.
