### **Professional Summary**

Innovative thought leader with over 25 years of experience in systems design, cybernetic governance, and sustainable civilization planning. Co-founder of the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics (2012–present), Joseph has pioneered an original synthesis of bioenergetics, sociocratic governance, game theory, and long-horizon ecological strategy known as **New Age Cybernetics (NAC)**.

His open-source frameworks — including **PlayNAC Game Theory Engine**, **EarnedPath adaptive education system**, **Personal Energy Resonance Codex (PERC)**, and **VERTECA smart-city governance model** — provide practical tools for equitable resource allocation, non-punitive social remediation, and resilient multi-century societal design.

Author of 200+ technical papers, white papers, and frameworks published on ResearchGate and Medium. Frequent collaborator with frontier AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) as co-researchers on governance and energy-dynamics models.

### **Core Competencies & Expertise**

* Bioenergetics & Semantic Energy Modeling (Kirlian-derived metrics, aura-tech integration)  
* Real-Time Adaptive Learning Architectures (EarnedPath, ERES Kernel)  
* Applied Game Theory Engines (PlayNAC-KERNEL, open-source)  
* Smart-City & Ecological Governance Protocols (VERTECA, GAIA NPR)

### **Professional Experience**

**Co-Founder & ERES Maestro**

ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics | 2012 – Present

* Founded and continue to lead an independent research institute dedicated to integrating bio-energetic principles with modern cybernetics and governance.  
* Designed and released \>15 major open-source frameworks and 200+ supporting documents used by sustainability researchers, sociocracy practitioners, and experimental governance communities worldwide.  
* Architect of PlayNAC-KERNEL — a real-time VR/AR-ready game-theory engine for equitable resource planning and decentralized decision-making (GitHub active).  
* Developed VERTECA (2024–2025), a comprehensive smart-city governance blueprint emphasizing non-punitive remediation and energy-based merit systems.  
* Regular publisher of forward-looking white papers on AI-assisted sociocracy, “Vacationomics,” and post-scarcity energy economies.

**Independent ICT Strategist & Systems Designer** (Self-Employed) | 1995 – 2012

* Delivered technology strategy, secure network architecture, and CRM solutions to SMEs, NGOs, and government-linked entities.  
* Early innovator in trusted virtual private networks (TVPN concept) and community-scale off-grid planning frameworks (“Gunnysack Earthship” model).  
* Served as President of CyberRAVE (1999–2005), presenting to U.S. Department of Homeland Security (CIAO 2002), The Open Group, and Internet Society forums.

### **Education**

**University of Oregon** | 1983 – 1986

Business Administration (focus on systems thinking and organizational behavior)

Continued self-directed research in cybernetics, bioenergetics, and complexity science (1986–present)
