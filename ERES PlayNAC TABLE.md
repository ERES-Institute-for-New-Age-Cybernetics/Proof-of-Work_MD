1. ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics has begun creating a "C-Level" application called PlayNAC which uses the principles of Game Theory to help assure help use and energy laws for business at large while aligning strategy, keeping all internal priorities well-organized.  
2. User-group members participate by assigning their own core-linguistic profile(s) among user-group best practices, thereby unifying personal-public-private preferences with a top-down, bottom-up approach revolutionizing social media and corporate communications.  
3. The principal keyword categories of existence fall into "17" rows of "7" subjects, whereas the selection and combination of items relative to the ‘self’ extend into the universe and can be seen by those participants who enable their questions and answers to be made available.  
4. Soon, by making data available to a Global Actuary Investor Authority (GAIA), large scale problems can be seen and dealt with at an appropriate level establishing Relative Energy Equal Pay (REEP) giving importance and scope with a Community of Interest (COI) the body of evidence needed for scientific study.  
5. Three levels provide the basis for conducting research: conscious, subconscious, unconscious... these form the ontology leading to self, where words can be arranged according with personal-public-private "preferences" giving new meaning to context-driven data bases and human-to-computer interactions.  
6. By logging onto your PlayNAC account daily and organizing work according with keyword categories, situations where Questions result in Answers provide well-formed Questions for real-world Answers to take shape.

**ERES PlayNAC “HowWay”**

* AnswerQuestion is dependent on “your” Dictum rating, which is a function of “ABC” digital record, or else biometric confession in the moment  
* A well-formed answer relates the question context and must conform to rules based assignments leading to output  
* Every principal keyword forms the basis for a Community of Interest (COI), which can involve many sub-domain COIs, down to three levels \= GAIA  
* Every domain is User/GROUP controlled and regulated:   
* EVERY LEVEL HAS RULES BASED ANSWERS DEFINING WELL-FORMED QUESTIONS \= SCIENTIFIC METHOD  
* LEVEL CONTROLS: first level  \= personal, second \= public, third \= private   
* EVERY GAIA “VOTE” CONSTITUTES A GLOBAL RULING CONCERNING A SPECIFIC USER/GROUP “DOMAIN”  
* Big Data forms an initial “BASIS” for GAIA (AI) rulings concerning a domain, or keyword within a domain  
* Domain “Intelligence Stacks” represent numeric values used for calculating Dictum and INPUTs relative to User/GROUP Intelligence  
* Domain AnswerQuestion(s) are classified according with Five (5) Principle AREAS of Distinction: ICARA SECUIR GUNNYSACK VERTECA EARNEDPATH  
* A ruling "governance framework" uses environmental history to classify social, economic, political, legal, technical and administrative changes
