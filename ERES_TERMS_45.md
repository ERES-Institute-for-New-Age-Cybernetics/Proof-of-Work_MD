ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics  
Joseph A. Sprute, Founder & Director  

**Document Version:** #45  
**Consolidation Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Status:** Definitive RECORD - Complete Archive Integration  
**Supersedes:** ERES TERMS #44 + ADDENDUM  

---

## INTRODUCTION

This document represents the **authoritative consolidation** of all terminology developed by the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics from February 2012 through January 2026, integrating:

- **ERES TERMS #43** (August 2025) - Core acronyms and philosophical foundations
- **ERES TERMS #44** (December 2025) - Neologism elimination with standard equivalents
- **ERES TERMS #44 ADDENDUM** - Newly discovered terms from comprehensive search
- **Constitutional Terms Key** (January 2026) - Living Constitution companion
- **Archive Discovery Terms** - 196 documents across 3 strategic collections

### Purpose

To provide the **complete semantic foundation** for New Age Cybernetics implementation while:

1. **Preserving original ERES definitions** (not interpretations)
2. **Eliminating linguistic barriers** through standard equivalents
3. **Maintaining conceptual integrity** across 13+ years development
4. **Creating authoritative RECORD** for all stakeholder audiences

### Structure - The Lagrange Points Framework

This document organizes ERES "Elementals" (core concepts) using a gravitational framework inspired by Lagrange Points - stable positions in the ERES semantic field where terms achieve balanced resonance:

**L1 - Core Philosophy** → NAC Cybernetic Principles  
**L2 - Governance Systems** → SOMT, PlayNAC, Constitutional Frameworks  
**L3 - Economic Systems** → UBIMIA, Meritcoin, Gracechain  
**L4 - Measurement Systems** → ARI, ERI, BERA, BEST  
**L5 - Infrastructure** → GERP, VERTECA, LOGOS, GAIA  

This prevents semantic drift while allowing terms to maintain their original definitions within the proper conceptual context.
