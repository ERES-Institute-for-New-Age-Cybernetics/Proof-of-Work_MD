### **Suggested Keyword Strategy**

* **For documents/PDFs/theses**: Use 8–12 primary \+ secondary in metadata/abstracts (e.g., "New Age Cybernetics, PlayNAC, GAIA Matrix, EarnedPath, UBIMIA, IDIPITIS, bio-energetic resonance, merit-based economies").  
* **For X/Substack/Medium posts**: 5–8 per post, mixing hashtags (e.g., \#NewAgeCybernetics \#PlayNAC \#Meritcoin \#BioEnergeticResonance \#GAIAMatrix \#ERESInstitute).  
* **For ResearchGate/SSRN**: Prioritize academic-friendly ones like "cybernetic governance", "merit recognition", "semantic coordination", "bio-energetic resonance", "planetary coordination".  
* **SEO/Visibility Boost**: Include cross-AI references (e.g., Grok xAI, Claude AI, Anthropic integration) when relevant to partnerships.
