Hiring Manager  
Cummins Power Systems

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within Cummins Power Systems. My background spans media systems design, cybernetic systems architecture, energy-capture prototyping, and multi-sector digital communications. Combined, these experiences give me a strong foundation to contribute meaningfully to advanced power-system development, energy recovery concepts, systems documentation, and cross-disciplinary innovation.

From 2002–2007, I served as a Media Consultant for **Colina Financial Group in The Bahamas**, where I helped develop the *Pillars of Data Insurance*—a foundational digital-continuity and corporate-data architecture initiative. I also maintained numerous corporate websites across multiple subsidiaries, helping modernize and unify digital communications for one of the region’s largest financial groups.

Since 2012, my work with the **ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics** has focused on large-scale systems design and energy-efficiency concepts, including experimental Proof-of-Work modules that harvest kinetic and thermal energy from rotating machinery. These include components designed to capture spinning-motor energy, transmit it through calibrated pathways, store it through battery collectors, and condition it via capacitors. My research aligns closely with regenerative power recovery, efficiency design, and next-generation power-system thinking.

My GitHub repositories—including the **PlayNAC-KERNEL**—demonstrate my commitment to structured documentation, clear system logic, and transparent operation. These principles fit naturally within Cummins’ emphasis on reliability, engineering precision, and long-term infrastructure performance.

I would welcome the opportunity to support Cummins in power-systems innovation, documentation, digital communications, or emerging-technology integration. It would be my pleasure to contribute to future advancements in business, engineering, and sustainable energy operations within your organization.

Thank you for your consideration. I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to contributing to Cummins Power Systems.

Sincerely,

**Joseph Allen Sprute**
