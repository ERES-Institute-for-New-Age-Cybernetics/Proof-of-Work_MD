**Abstract**

This paper introduces the Resonant Harmony Cycle (RHC), a cybernetic framework integrating bio-electric resonance metrics, merit-based economics, and triadic guardianship to enable self-sustaining, regenerative civilizations both on Earth and extraterrestrially. Drawing from bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS/CELSS), ecological closed-loop principles, and interdisciplinary cybernetics, the ERES (Empirical Realtime Education System) architecture addresses existential risks—including geomagnetic reversals, ecological collapse, and long-duration isolation—through adaptive, measurable harmony across human, technological, and ecological scales.

Key components include the 1000-Year Future Map for phased scaling, UBIMIA (Universal Basic Income Merits Incentives Accounts) for resonant resource allocation, NBERS (National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score) as an alternative to GDP, and the SPRT Trinity (embodied as DALEMAJAS) for distributed moral-practical-innovative stewardship. Applied to off-planet habitats (e.g., Mega-Super Dome structures with modular outgrowths for closed-loop soils, air, water, and biodiversity), the framework complements existing BLSS roadmaps (NASA, ESA MELiSSA, China's programs) by adding human psychological/ecological resonance layers.

We argue that proven off-planet self-sufficiency serves as ultimate planetary insurance, hedging against Earth-bound catastrophes. Empirical testability via resonance indices (ARI/ERI) and merit tracking positions this as a viable path toward multi-world homeostasis.

**1\. Introduction**

Humanity faces escalating systemic risks: climate tipping points, resource depletion, geomagnetic field weakening, and the need for long-duration space presence. Traditional physicochemical life support suffices for short missions, but self-sustaining settlements on the Moon or Mars require bioregenerative approaches (BLSS/CELSS) that recycle air, water, nutrients, and waste via biological processes (MacElroy & Averner, 1985; Porterfield et al., 2025).

This paper proposes the **Resonant Harmony Cybernetics** framework from the ERES Institute, extending BLSS with cybernetic feedback, bio-electric coherence, and merit-aligned governance to ensure psychological, ecological, and technological stability over centuries. Informed by analogs (Biosphere 2, MELiSSA) and cybernetic theory (Wiener, 1948; Beer viable systems), it envisions habitats like the Mega-Super Dome: a central enclosing structure with emergent "wart & mushroom" modules for specialized regenerative functions.

**2\. Theoretical Foundations**  
**2.1 Cybernetic Principles in Closed Systems**

Cybernetics emphasizes feedback, self-regulation, and requisite variety (Ashby, 1956). In BLSS, this manifests as control loops for O₂/CO₂ balance, nutrient cycling, and waste processing (Babcock & Auslander, 1985). RHC advances this by incorporating bio-electric signatures (HRV/polyvagal coherence) for human-ecosystem resonance, preventing cascades observed in Biosphere 2\.

**2.2 Bioregenerative Integration**

Higher plants, microalgae, and potential insects/fish form trophic levels (Berggren et al., 2025). In-situ regolith processing builds soils (via mycorrhizae, legumes). The Mega-Super Dome centralizes shielding/radiation protection while modular outgrowths enable localized adaptation (e.g., hydroponics, bioreactors).

**3\. The ERES Framework**  
**3.1 Resonant Harmony Cycle (RHC v3.0)**

A triune loop: input (bio-signatures/ecological data), process (real-time adjustment via ARI/ERI metrics), output (harmonized stability). Measurable via Aura Resonance Index.

**3.2 Merit-Resonance Economy**

UBIMIA provides baseline security; Graceful Contribution Formula quantifies resonant output. Meritcoin tokenizes impact, mitigating risks in long-horizon investments.

**3.3 SPRT Trinity (DALEMAJAS)**

Spiritual/moral (compassionate compass), practical/structural (trusts/stewardship), innovative/technological (scaling continuity). One layer interprets polarity-unity archetypes for transformative resilience.

**3.4 Empirical Realtime Education System**

Data-entangled adaptive learning fosters merit alignment and error-correction in isolated habitats.

**4\. Application to Off-Planet Habitats**

Phased 1000-Year Future Map: foundational tech (2012–2050), scaling (2050–2100), homeostasis. Off-planet proof (e.g., Mars Mega-Super Dome) hedges Earth risks, including transitional geomagnetic weakening (increased solar storm vulnerability). Self-sustainability establishes insurance-like redundancy.

**5\. Discussion**

Challenges: integration complexity, low-gravity effects, radiation. Strengths: empirical metrics enable iterative refinement; aligns with NASA/ESA/China BLSS. Future work: pilot simulations, resonance validation.

**6\. Conclusions**

Resonant Harmony Cybernetics offers a testable, holistic path to multi-world flourishing. By proving self-sustaining off-planet systems, humanity gains existential backup—resonant, merit-driven, and guarded across generations.
