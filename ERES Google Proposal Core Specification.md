### **ERES NAC Core Technical Specifications**

| Component | Technical Function & Specification | Input/Measurement Source | Governance Integration |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **NBERS** (National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score) | A successor metric to GDP that aggregates four main domains: ecological integrity, social equity, human health, and systemic resilience. It operates as the "score" inside a Smart-City **TETRA-CERT control loop**. | Aggregates data from **ERI/ARI**, **GERP** (resource efficiency), and **EPIR-Q** (Emotional Personal IQ Real and Quantum). | Used to **steer policy, procurement, and finance**. It enables conditioned, NBERS-indexed disbursement. |
| **GERP** (Generalized Ephemeralization Resource Proxy) | The metric designed to measure resource efficiency towards post-scarcity, based on the principle of Ephemeralization ("Doing More with Less"). Acts as a resource planning/spatial planning component. | Bio-Economic Resource Cyberspace (**BERC**), resource flow data, and efficiency metrics. | Integrates with the **EarnedPath Engine** to establish **VACATIONOMICS**. |
| **GtC=ME** (Multi-Domain Cryptography) | A **quantum-resistant** cryptographic framework that provides digital signatures by combining four distinct key domains to prevent single-point compromise. | **G (Water Key):** Corresponds to global or fluid resources. **t (Land Key):** Corresponds to territorial or physical resources. **C (Cognition Key):** Corresponds to human identity/intent. **E (Energy/Matter Attestation):** Physically anchors the digital action to observable reality. | Implements the **P3 visibility model** (Personal, Private, Public per domain) to govern access and authorization. Ensures **1,000-year auditability**. |
| **ERI** (Emission Resonance Index) | A practical framework proposed to measure resonance based on **established scientific principles** (physics, chemistry) rather than the speculative "Aura Hypothesis". | Measures three specific types of resonance: **1\. Biochemical Resonance:** Spectral analysis of VOC/lipid emissions (e.g., FTIR/Raman spectroscopy). **2\. Physiological Resonance:** Synchronized biological rhythms (e.g., HRV coherence). **3\. Behavioral Resonance:** Pattern alignment in movement, speech, micro-expressions (e.g., motion capture, vocal analysis). | Provides high-fidelity, validated input into the NBERS/EarnedPath system, intended for consensual applications only. |
| **ARI** (Aura Resonance Index) | The **conceptual predecessor** and bioenergetic dashboard designed to quantify human-environment coherence. | Fuses multi-modal inputs: **Biometric** (EEG, HRV), **Environmental** (CO2, resource flows), and **Social** (equity codices). **Technical Implementation:** Uses **Fourier Analysis** of Kirlian-Biometric data and **Munsell Color Awareness** for perceptual mapping. | Enables **Operators in S3 Cities** to perform **Non-Punitive Remediation (NPR)** of systemic imbalances. |
| **EarnedPath (EP)** | The **governance engine** within the Empirical Realtime Education System (ERES) that links individual contribution to reward. | Driven by **EPIR-Q** (Emotional Personal IQ Real and Quantum), which converts individual and systemic choices into quantifiable ratings. | Disburses benefits and resources, creating the **VACATIONOMICS** economic model based on **merit over credentials**. |
