# **ERES W Matrix (Completed with SEPLTA)**

### **1\. GSSG / ARI / SUGAR**

* **Social**: Community energy trust built on shared solar resonance

* **Economic**: Bio-ecologic valuation through Green Solar-Sand Glass as currency substrate

* **Political**: Policy stewardship via Aura Resonance Index (ARI) for collective rights

* **Legal**: Regulatory framing through SUGAR contracts (Sociocratic Universal Governance Aura Regulation)

* **Technical**: Energy conversion & spectral measurement of resonance values

* **Administrative**: Governance dashboards monitoring deployment across user-groups

---

### **2\. Bioenergetics / Resonance / Aura**

* **Social**: Cultural harmonics, empathy, and shared resonance practices

* **Economic**: Integration of resonance scores into NBERS and UBIMIA allocations

* **Political**: Representation of “energy equity” within civic and interplanetary charters

* **Legal**: Aura protocols recognized as evidentiary biometric signatures

* **Technical**: Fourier, Kirlian, and Munsell-based biometric instrumentation

* **Administrative**: Oversight by GAIA through EPIR-Q normalization and reporting

---

### **3\. Energy / Reason / About**

* **Social**: Public education on personal energy responsibility and resonance ethics

* **Economic**: Energy credit exchange tethered to UBIMIA & GCF multipliers

* **Political**: Rational consensus-building through CARE-based deliberation systems

* **Legal**: Codification of “Reasoned Energy Use” within bio-ecologic statutes

* **Technical**: Energy mapping across Sun–Earth–Moon cycles for resource alignment

* **Administrative**: EarnedPath training modules for monitoring and remediation cycles
