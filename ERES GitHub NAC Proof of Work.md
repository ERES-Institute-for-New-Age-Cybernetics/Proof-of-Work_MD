## What is New Age Cybernetics (NAC)?

New Age Cybernetics (NAC), pioneered by the ERES Institute, is a forward-thinking, multidisciplinary approach that addresses the complexities of our interconnected world. It combines elements of empirical real-time education systems, economic systems with environmental sustainability through AI-driven cybernetic models, and frameworks for equitable, sustainable, and merit-based value distribution. NAC aims to chart a 1000-year roadmap for a graceful evolution of civilization, focusing on smart city development and integrating various core frameworks.
