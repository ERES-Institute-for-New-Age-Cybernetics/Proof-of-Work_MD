Proof‑of‑Work_MD: Documenting Merit and Regeneration
A digital ledger for tracking contributions, socio‑ecologic impact and visionary frameworks in the New Age Cybernetics ecosystem.

Visual Summary
The Proof‑of‑Work_MD repository serves as a collective logbook for the ERES Institute’s civic experiments. It blends data‑driven metrics with human stories. To illustrate the dual themes of accountability and regeneration, the first image below depicts a luminous network of nodes and pathways – an abstract “ledger” where contributions are recorded and connected:



Complementing this, the second image evokes the philosophy of Vacationomics. Organic swirls and geometric patterns merge, hinting at a world where ecological recovery, equitable rest and technological coordination are in harmony:

Introduction
Proof‑of‑Work_MD is a Markdown‑based repository maintained by the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics. It functions as a digital ledger and documentation centre for projects that advance human merit, socio‑ecological regeneration and simulation‑based governance
github.com
. Instead of code, the repository stores evidence of work: journal entries, white papers and conceptual frameworks that feed into the wider ERES ecosystem (PlayNAC, Mandala‑VERTECA, GAIA, etc.).

The idea is to apply the same rigour used in blockchain proof‑of‑work to human contributions. Each entry captures what was done, the impact on people and planet, and how it aligns with New Age Cybernetics principles. By tracking contributions across education, design, governance and research, the community can recognise merit, reward collaboration and collectively build a regenerative future.

What Is Proof‑of‑Work_MD?
The repository was created to record and archive individual or institutional contributions related to several core ERES systems
github.com
:

EarnedPath – a real‑time system for measuring skill acquisition and civic contributions, used to assign merit
github.com
.

Graceful Contribution Formula (GCF) – an incentive mechanism that integrates universal basic income, merit, investments and awards into a humane token model
github.com
.

Bio‑Ecologic Ratings Codex (BERC) – a regenerative index that scores projects based on ecological impact, intelligence and design quality
github.com
.

Vacationomics – the concept of empowering global equity through rest, rejuvenation and distributed labour
github.com
.

These concepts form the backbone of ERES’s approach to New Age Cybernetics, a civilisation‑scale project aiming to design the future responsibly and equitably
github.com
. Proof‑of‑Work_MD provides the place to document progress toward that goal.

Key Concepts
Concept	Purpose
EarnedPath (EP)	Measures personal growth and community contributions in real time, enabling merit‑based recognition
github.com
.
Graceful Contribution Formula (GCF)	Combines universal basic income, merit, investment returns and awards to distribute resources fairly
github.com
.
Bio‑Ecologic Ratings Codex (BERC)	Evaluates the regenerative impact of actions and projects, factoring ecological health, intelligence and design
github.com
.
Vacationomics	Advocates for equitable rest and the redistribution of labour; recognises that leisure and rejuvenation are integral to socio‑ecologic health
github.com
.

Additional Rating Codices and Dependencies
Beyond the core systems above, the ERES Institute is developing a set of interlocking rating codices to evaluate performance at different scales. Together these codices are sometimes referred to as PBJ (PERC–BERC–JERC), and they draw on other modules such as UBIMIA, GCF and NBERS:

BERC (Bio‑Ecologic Ratings Codex) – already outlined above, BERC measures ecological and economic impacts at a project level. In the PlayNAC documentation it is described as aligning economic activities with ecological health and tracking the balance between them
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

PERC (Personal Ecologic Ratings Codex) – a proposed personal‑scale codex that adapts the BERC methodology to individual actions. PERC entries would use UBIMIA data (Universal Basic Income + Merit × Investment ± Awards) and GCF metrics to calculate a person’s regenerative contribution.

JERC (Justice & Energy Reference Codex) – an envisioned codex focusing on justice and energy metrics. JERC would integrate with national assessments via NBERS (National Bio‑Ecologic Resource Score), a system for calculating country‑level resource scores
raw.githubusercontent.com
. These scores inform policy decisions and resource allocations.

Because PERC and JERC are still in development, you will not find templates for them in this repository yet. However, the existing BERC templates and UBIMIA/GCF formulas lay the groundwork for future integration.

Repository Structure
The repository is organised into directories to facilitate organised journaling and research
github.com

The vision folder contains white papers like ERES Mandala‑VERTECA Alignment, which outlines a translation layer between human cognitive patterns (the five fingers) and computational systems (the QWERTY keyboard) to integrate New Age Cybernetics principles into emergency management
github.com
. Documents such as the 1000‑Year Future Map series, architectural proposals and security plans also reside here, offering context and inspiration for contributors.

Getting Started
Explore the templates – look inside the templates/ directory for Markdown files that provide a structure for proof‑of‑work journaling. These templates typically include fields for:

Contributor name & date

Activity description – what you did and why

Impact assessment – how the work benefits people and planet

Alignment – which ERES concepts (EP, GCF, BERC, Vacationomics) your entry advances

Next steps – follow‑up actions or proposals

Create a new entry – copy a template, fill in the fields and save it in the submissions/ directory with a meaningful filename (e.g., 2025‑07‑25_my‑project.md). Commit the file via a pull request. Remember to commit early and often; smaller, incremental contributions are easier to review and reward.

Reference vision documents – if your work builds on a strategic paper, cite the relevant section. For example, if your project involves translating human gestures into digital inputs, reference the MANDALA‑VERTECA framework’s Five‑Fingers to QWERTY model
github.com
.

Track impact – use the EP and BERC metrics to quantify outcomes where possible. If you need guidance on calculating GCF rewards or BERC scores, open an issue or consult with the community.

Vision & Reference Documents
The vision folder contains conceptual frameworks and strategic reports that inform the broader ERES roadmap. Highlights include:

Mandala‑VERTECA Alignment – introduces a translation layer between human cognition (5‑Fingers) and computational systems, enabling real‑time integration of New Age Cybernetics into emergency management
github.com
. It maps each finger to a societal domain (resource integrity, population mobility, civic continuity, relational sovereignty and security) and describes a 4D VR/AR implementation aligned with the Enneagram
github.com
.

1000‑Year Future Maps – envision long‑term trajectories for global unity and cybernetic integration. These documents explore scenarios involving advanced AI, ecological stewardship and humanity’s collective evolution.

Architectural Proposals and Security Plans – describe boundaryless infrastructures, bio‑energetic systems and adaptive security models that align with the ERES mission.

These resources are designed to inspire and guide your contributions. You don’t need to absorb them all at once; instead, draw on them when your work intersects with their themes.
