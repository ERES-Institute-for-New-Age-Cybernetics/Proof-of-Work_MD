Introduction
PlayNAC (short for Play New‑Age Cybernetics) is a symbolic decision‑making simulation system used to resolve conflict, optimise governance and guide personal development
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Developed by the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics, the platform combines a voice‑operated “ship’s computer” with a suite of modules that model ecology, economy, resource planning and merit‑based incentives. The system runs on top of the Empirical Realtime Education System (ERES) and uses Hands‑Free Voice Navigation (HFVN) as its spoken interface layer
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

At its core, PlayNAC uses the EarnedPath (EP) engine to track personal growth and civic contributions
raw.githubusercontent.com
, the GERP (Global Earth Resource Planner) to coordinate planetary logistics
raw.githubusercontent.com
 and the BERC (Bio‑Ecologic Ratings Codex) to measure ecological and policy impacts
raw.githubusercontent.com
. A blockchain‑based Graceful Contribution Formula (GCF) and Meritcoin rewards system incentivise positive contributions and ecological stewardship.

This README summarises the concepts, modules and usage patterns of the PlayNAC KERNEL. It is intended for researchers, developers and civic technologists interested in sustainable governance, resource modelling and human‑centred simulation.

Core Modules
The PlayNAC KERNEL is organised into 12 interlocking modules, each handling a specific aspect of the simulation engine:

Module	Purpose
Binary Symbol & Trifurcation Logic	Implements the symbolic structure $IT = 0110 1001 == 1001 0110, with a DEAL (Discussion–Description–Table) that separates personal, public and private values and a Choice Function to compute equilibrium
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
CARE Module	Core property management focusing on water, immigration and security; uses a Protect & Enrich (PE) function to prioritise human welfare
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
GEO Perspective System	Aligns goals and spiritual intention via the GO<O>D framework; anchors data to longitude/latitude and links simulations to long‑term non‑punitive remediation plans
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
SOMT (Solid‑State Sustainability)	Records immutable sustainability states through a Global Earth Applications Recorder (GEAR); uses hash verification to ensure integrity
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
EarnedPath System	Tracks skill acquisition and contributions with curriculum planning methodologies (CPM/WBS/PERT)
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
GERP Engine	Manages planetary resources through optimisation algorithms, zone registration and intelligent distribution
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
BEE Framework	Monitors ecological indicators, computes sustainability scores and maps ecological‑economic flows
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
BERC (Bio‑Ecologic Economy)	Aligns economic activities with ecological health, values resources based on ecological impact and tracks economic–ecologic balance
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
NBERS	Calculates national Bio‑Ecologic Resource Scores and produces policy‑relevant assessments of resource availability
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
GCF (Graceful Contribution Formula)	Connects the Gracechain blockchain with Meritcoin rewards; calculates token incentives based on ecological and social impact
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
PlayNAC Game Engine	Provides scenario management for real‑world simulations; enables multi‑player civic engagement with merit‑based rewards
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
Voice Navigation (VERTECA)	Offers hands‑free operation via speech recognition, intent routing and 4D VR integration
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

Each module can be enabled or disabled at configuration time. Combined, they allow complex simulations where individuals and communities make decisions, track merit, allocate resources and receive immediate feedback on ecological and social outcomes.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
The code examples in this repository are Python‑based and rely on a small set of third‑party libraries:

SpeechRecognition – converts audio into text. The PyPI metadata indicates that this package is released under the BSD licence
pypi.org
.

PyAudio – provides cross‑platform audio I/O bindings. The project homepage notes that PyAudio is distributed under the MIT Licence
people.csail.mit.edu
.

web3.py – interacts with Ethereum‑compatible blockchains. The PyPI project page lists its licence as MIT
pypi.org
.

You should install these dependencies with pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pyaudio
pip install web3
A full PlayNAC implementation would also require code for each module (EarnedPath, GERP, BEE, etc.) plus configuration files and smart‑contract ABI definitions for Gracechain. The current repository contains conceptual prototypes and design documents rather than a ready‑to‑run package.

Quick Start Example
The following minimal example demonstrates how voice commands could be routed into different modules. It is adapted from the ERES PlayNAC Codebase (V.1) prototype and shows how speech input triggers GERP, GCF, BERC and NBERS functions
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

python
Copy
Edit
import speech_recognition as sr
from web3 import Web3

class PlayNACKernel:
    def __init__(self, kernel):
        self.kernel = kernel  # encapsulates EP, GERP, BEE, etc.
        self.recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
        self.web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://gracechain-node.example.com"))

    def start_voice_control(self):
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print("Listening for commands...")
            audio = self.recognizer.listen(source)
            command = self.recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
            self.process_command(command)

    def process_command(self, command: str):
        cmd = command.lower()
        if "resource" in cmd:
            # route to GERP for resource allocation
            self.kernel.gerp.process_allocation(cmd)
        elif "merit" in cmd:
            # distribute Meritcoin using GCF
            self.distribute_meritcoin(cmd)
        elif "ecologic" in cmd:
            # assess economy using BERC metrics
            print(self.kernel.berc.assess(cmd))
        elif "national score" in cmd:
            # calculate national ecological score via NBERS
            print(self.kernel.nbers.calculate(cmd))

    def distribute_meritcoin(self, command: str):
        # simplified example for interacting with Gracechain
        contribution = self.kernel.gcf.parse_contribution(command)
        amount = self.kernel.gcf.calculate_reward(contribution)
        user_address = self.web3.eth.accounts[0]
        # send a transaction (pseudo‑code)
        tx = {
            "to": "0xGracechainContractAddress",
            "data": self.kernel.gcf.build_tx_data(user_address, amount),
        }
        self.web3.eth.send_transaction(tx)
This example assumes that the kernel object exposes .gerp, .gcf, .berc and .nbers attributes corresponding to the modules described above. Real implementations would also handle authentication (FAVORS), error handling and asynchronous processing.

Repository Structure
The PlayNAC‑KERNEL repository acts more like an encyclopaedia and archive than a typical software project. Key contents include:

Design documents and whitepapers – numerous PDF files describe the conceptual foundations of New‑Age Cybernetics (e.g., the CA² formulas for collision avoidance and conflict resolution, governance protocols, energy law analyses, etc.).

Code prototypes – Markdown files (ERES PlayNAC Codebase (V.1).markdown, ERES PlayNAC ChatGPT Coding (V.1).md) contain prototype Python code for the KERNEL, CARE/GEAR interfaces and symbolic logic.

Glossary & Terms – the ERES TERMS & LICENSE.pdf provides definitions for acronyms (HFVN, GAIA, BERC, UBIMIA, etc.) and summarises the special licence
raw.githubusercontent.com
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

License documents – ERES TERMS & LICENSE.pdf and Eres 1000year Foundation License.pdf outline the CAREWARE licence terms (see below).

Since most code currently lives inside the documentation, contributors typically develop new modules in separate repositories or notebooks and link them back to this archive.

Open‑Source Components
While PlayNAC is a bespoke system, it builds on several open‑source libraries:

Component	Role	Licence
SpeechRecognition	Converts microphone input into transcribed text for HFVN. PyPI lists its licence as BSD
pypi.org
.	BSD‑3‑Clause
PyAudio	Provides low‑level audio I/O bindings used by SpeechRecognition. The library’s author notes that PyAudio is distributed under the MIT Licence
people.csail.mit.edu
.	MIT
web3.py	Interfaces with Gracechain or other Ethereum‑compatible blockchains. The PyPI project page specifies an MIT Licence
pypi.org
.	MIT

Developers integrating these libraries should respect their respective licences when redistributing PlayNAC‑based software.
