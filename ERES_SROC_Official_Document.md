## Preamble

This document defines, operationalizes, and officially adopts **SROC — Smart-Resonant Offset Contract(s)** as a foundational economic and governance instrument of the New Age Cybernetics (NAC) framework. It is issued for the use of **Communities of Interest** — any group of citizens, organizations, municipalities, cooperatives, or multi-stakeholder bodies that have chosen to govern themselves through resonance-aligned principles.

A Community of Interest, as defined within NAC, is not a geographic unit alone. It is any self-identified collective whose members share a commitment to the ERES Triune — **Rights, Roles, and Rules** — and whose economic and ecological activity can be measured, validated, and offset through the SROC mechanism.

SROC is not a financial derivative. It is not a carbon credit in the legacy sense. It is a living contract — one whose terms are not fixed at signing but continuously updated by the empirical resonance state of the community that issued it. The "Smart" in SROC is not a reference to blockchain automation alone. The resonance **is** the smart. The contract is intelligent because it is alive to its own ecological and biological context.

---

## Part I: Definition and Conceptual Foundation

### 1.1 What Is a Smart-Resonant Offset Contract?

A **Smart-Resonant Offset Contract (SROC)** is a biometrically grounded, resonance-validated, community-issued instrument that:

1. **Recognizes** the ecological and social contribution of a defined Community of Interest
2. **Offsets** the extraction costs and ecological debts incurred by that community's activity
3. **Adjusts** its value dynamically in real time, weighted by the community's current ARI (Aura Resonance Index) and ERI (Emission Resonance Index) scores
4. **Records** all transactions permanently and transparently on the GraceChain ledger
5. **Distributes** offset value through the UBIMIA Accounts of participating community members
6. **Self-corrects** through the REEPER empirical feedback loop

The hyphen in **Smart-Resonant** is constitutional. It signals that these two qualities are not additive — they are fused. A contract that is smart but not resonant is merely automated extraction. A resonance that is not made smart (measurable, transmissible, contractually binding) remains invisible to governance systems. SROC is the instrument through which resonance becomes economically legible.

### 1.2 The Definitional Shift: From Registered to Resonant

Previous NAC documentation used the phrase *Smart Registered Offset Contracts*. This document formally updates the canonical definition to **Smart-Resonant Offset Contract(s)**.

The shift from *Registered* to *Resonant* is not cosmetic. It reflects a fundamental evolution in the framework's understanding of what makes an offset contract valid:

| Legacy Term | New Age Cybernetics Term | Significance |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Registered | Resonant | Validity comes from measured alignment, not administrative enrollment |
| Fixed value at issuance | Dynamically ARI/ERI-weighted | Contracts are alive to their context |
| Institutional verification | Oracle + biometric validation | Trust is distributed and empirical, not credentialed |
| Carbon unit denominated | Social Bio-Ecologic unit denominated | Offset covers ecological, biological, and social dimensions |

A *registered* contract derives its authority from an institution that has enrolled it in a registry. A *resonant* contract derives its authority from the measured state of the living system it governs. SROC's authority is its resonance score — verified continuously, not stamped once.

### 1.3 SROC Within the VECTOR Framework

SROC sits within the **UBIMIA** module of VECTOR — specifically within the **Incentives** layer — but it draws from and feeds back into every other module in the loop:

```
         CBGMOD
    (Stakeholder Rights)
           |
           |
REEPER --- VECTOR --- FAVORS
(Monitors     (Loop    (Identity
 & corrects)   core)    & Aura)
           |
           |
         SECUIR
    (Energy substrate)
           |
         UBIMIA
    [UBI · Merit · INCENTIVES · Accounts]
                        ↑
                      SROC
           (lives here — Incentives layer)
```

SROC is the primary instrument through which the **Incentives** component of UBIMIA is operationalized. It transforms the abstract principle of ecological and social contribution into a concrete, tradeable, accountable economic unit — denominated in resonance.

The VECTOR formula that governs SROC's core calculation is derived from the ERES Triune constitutional theorem:

> **C = R × P / M**

Where SROC's role is to ensure that **R** (Resonance) is never treated as a free externality within the economic system. SROC makes R *costly to diminish* and *profitable to build* — structurally incentivizing the ecological and social alignment that C requires.

---

## Part II: The Three Pillars of SROC

Every SROC instrument rests on three pillars, directly mapped to the ERES Triune:

### Pillar 1 — Rights (The Entitlement Layer)

Every Community of Interest that participates in the NAC framework holds an inherent **right to ecological offset recognition**. This right is not granted by a government or institution — it is established biometrically through FAVORS and empirically through ARI/ERI measurement.

The Rights pillar of SROC establishes:

- Every community has the right to have its ecological contributions measured and compensated
- Every individual within that community, identified through FAVORS biometrics, holds a proportional share of the community's SROC value within their UBIMIA Account
- No SROC instrument may be issued, traded, or retired in a manner that diminishes the Rights of any CBGMOD stakeholder class — specifically Citizens and Dignitaries

### Pillar 2 — Roles (The Operational Layer)

The CBGMOD stakeholder classes each carry specific Roles within the SROC ecosystem:

| Stakeholder | SROC Role | Accountability |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Citizen** | Primary beneficiary; FAVORS-authenticated participant; generates ARI data | UBIMIA Account holder |
| **Business** | SROC issuer (ecological contribution); Meritcoin participant | ERI performance reporting |
| **Government** | SROC protocol enforcement; ECVS governance of SROC parameters | SOMT merit tracking |
| **Military** | Infrastructure protection (SECUIR/GSSG integrity); emergency SROC activation | REEPER emergency protocols |
| **Ombudsman** | Dispute mediation in SROC valuations; conflict resolution (M × E + C = R) | Community of Interest representation |
| **Dignitary** | Wisdom advisory on SROC parameter evolution; long-horizon validation | 1000-Year Future Map alignment |

### Pillar 3 — Rules (The Protocol Layer)

The Rules governing SROC are not administrative conventions. They are derived from the physical and biological laws that govern resonance itself:

**Rule 1 — The Resonance Primacy Rule:**
No SROC instrument may be valued in a manner that treats ecological resonance (R in C = R × P / M) as less than primary. Any valuation model that discounts R in favor of short-term M (merit extraction) is constitutionally invalid within NAC.

**Rule 2 — The Dynamic Adjustment Rule:**
SROC values are never fixed. They are recalculated on a continuous cycle, weighted by the issuing community's current ARI and ERI scores. A community improving its resonance alignment sees its SROC value increase. A community degrading its resonance sees its SROC value decrease — generating an automatic economic incentive for correction.

**Rule 3 — The Biometric Grounding Rule:**
All SROC instruments must be anchored to FAVORS-verified identities. No anonymous or institutional issuance. The human body — its Aura, its voice, its fingerprint — is the ultimate guarantor of SROC authenticity.

**Rule 4 — The System Comments Rule:**
Every SROC transaction generates a System Comment — a machine-readable, community-readable annotation that describes the ecological and social state of the issuing community at the time of transaction. These comments feed REEPER, inform CBGMOD governance, and constitute the living amendment record of the SROC ecosystem.

**Rule 5 — The Circular Non-Extraction Rule:**
Derived directly from SECUIR (Silent Energy Circular Universe Infinite Rotation), this rule prohibits SROC instruments from being used to offset extraction that exceeds the regenerative capacity of the affected ecosystem. SROC offsets what can be regenerated. It does not license perpetual extraction.

---

## Part III: The SROC Formula

### 3.1 Core Valuation

The adjusted value of any SROC instrument is calculated as:

> **SROC_adjusted = SROC_baseline × f(ARI, ERI)**

Where:

- **SROC_baseline** = The base ecological contribution value of the issuing community's activity, measured in Social Bio-Ecologic Units (SBEU)
- **f(ARI, ERI)** = The resonance multiplier function, derived from:
  - **ARI** (Aura Resonance Index) — the community's aggregate biometric coherence score, sourced from FAVORS-authenticated Kirlianographic measurement
  - **ERI** (Emission Resonance Index) — the community's aggregate emission alignment score, sourced from SECUIR infrastructure sensors and GSSG network data

The resonance multiplier f(ARI, ERI) operates on a continuous scale:

| Resonance State | f(ARI, ERI) Range | SROC Effect |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| High coherence, low emissions | 1.5 – 2.0 | SROC value amplified — community rewarded |
| Moderate coherence, moderate emissions | 0.8 – 1.2 | SROC value neutral — baseline maintained |
| Low coherence, high emissions | 0.3 – 0.7 | SROC value reduced — automatic correction signal |
| Crisis state (REEPER Emergency Room active) | 0.1 – 0.3 | SROC value minimized — emergency protocol deployed |

### 3.2 The GERP Integration

SROC does not exist in isolation from planetary resource planning. Through the GERP (Global Earth Resource Planner), SROC instruments are integrated into the long-horizon resource allocation framework:

> **Vacationomics Score = SOMT × BERC × (ERI / ARI)**

This formula governs the work-leisure balance of communities holding SROC instruments. A community with high SROC value (high ARI, aligned ERI) earns a higher Vacationomics Score — meaning its citizens are entitled to greater rest, leisure, and recreational resource allocation within the GERP system. The right to rest is not incidental — it is a direct function of the community's ecological alignment.

### 3.3 Social Bio-Ecologic Unit (SBEU)

SROC is denominated in **Social Bio-Ecologic Units (SBEU)** — not dollars, not carbon tonnes, not any legacy economic measure. The SBEU is defined as:

> **1 SBEU = the unit of ecological and social contribution required to sustain one human being at dignified baseline (BERC threshold) within a resonance-aligned community for one standard cycle**

The SBEU is therefore simultaneously:
- A biological unit (calibrated to REEPER's Relative Energy and BERC measurement)
- A social unit (calibrated to UBIMIA's UBI floor and community contribution norms)
- An ecological unit (calibrated to ERI and SROC regenerative capacity)

This triple grounding is what makes SROC a genuinely Social Bio-Ecologic economic instrument — not a financial abstraction mapped onto nature, but a measurement of nature made legible to economics.

## Part IV: SROC Lifecycle

### 4.1 Issuance

A SROC instrument is issued when a Community of Interest:

1. Registers its Community of Interest status through CBGMOD governance protocols
2. Completes FAVORS biometric enrollment for all participating citizens
3. Establishes baseline ARI and ERI measurements through Kirlianographic and SECUIR sensor networks
4. Calculates SROC_baseline through SBEU assessment
5. Submits the instrument to GraceChain for oracle attestation and ledger registration
6. Receives SROC_adjusted value, weighted by initial f(ARI, ERI) multiplier

**System Comment generated at issuance:** A permanent record of the community's biometric, ecological, and social state at the moment of SROC creation — the baseline against which all future adjustments are measured.

### 4.2 Continuous Adjustment

Once issued, SROC instruments are not static. The REEPER empirical feedback loop continuously monitors:

- **ARI drift** — changes in community biofield coherence, sourced from ongoing Kirlianographic measurement through FAVORS-authenticated community sensors
- **ERI drift** — changes in emission alignment, sourced from SECUIR/GSSG infrastructure data
- **UBIMIA Account activity** — merit and contribution patterns that signal community health or distress
- **PlayNAC EarnedPath progression** — community learning and engagement metrics that feed REEPER's System Comments

Each monitoring cycle produces an updated f(ARI, ERI) value, which automatically adjusts all active SROC instruments within the community's portfolio. No administrative action is required — the contract adjusts because the resonance adjusts.

### 4.3 Exchange and Trade

SROC instruments may be exchanged between Communities of Interest within the GraceChain network under the following conditions:

- Both issuing and receiving communities must be FAVORS-enrolled and CBGMOD-registered
- Exchange values are calculated in SBEU at the time of transaction, using both communities' current SROC_adjusted values
- All exchanges generate System Comments that are permanently recorded on both communities' GraceChain ledgers
- The Ombudsman class within CBGMOD holds mediation authority over disputed exchanges (M × E + C = R)

### 4.4 Retirement

A SROC instrument is retired when:

- The offset obligation it represents has been fully regenerated (ERI returns to baseline or above)
- The issuing community dissolves or merges its Community of Interest registration
- REEPER Emergency Room protocols determine the instrument has become ecologically unsupportable

Retired SROC instruments are not deleted. Their permanent record remains on GraceChain as a System Comment archive — the institutional memory of the community's ecological and social history. This archive feeds the ERES 1000-Year Future Map as empirical data.

## Part V: SROC and the Information Loop

### 5.1 How SROC Completes the VECTOR Loop

SROC is the economic instrument that makes the VECTOR infomediation loop financially binding. Without SROC, the loop can observe, measure, and report — but cannot *compel*. SROC introduces economic consequence to resonance misalignment, completing the loop's corrective function:

```
CBGMOD
  ↓  Establishes who can issue and govern SROC
FAVORS
  ↓  Authenticates identity; provides ARI baseline via Kirlianography
SECUIR
  ↓  Provides ERI data via GSSG/HFVN sensor network; stores SROC instruments
     in key-infused graphene infrastructure layer
UBIMIA [Incentives → SROC]
  ↓  Distributes SROC value through Merit-weighted Accounts
REEPER
  ↓  Monitors ARI/ERI drift; generates System Comments; triggers
     Emergency Room if SROC values fall below crisis threshold
VECTOR
  ↓  Validates, records, transmits all SROC activity; closes loop
     → feeds updated community state back into CBGMOD
```

Every SROC transaction is simultaneously: a governance act (CBGMOD), an identity event (FAVORS), an energy record (SECUIR), an economic distribution (UBIMIA), a learning signal (REEPER), and a loop iteration (VECTOR). This is what it means for SROC to be a *living* contract.

### 5.2 PlayNAC and SROC

Within PlayNAC, SROC instruments function as **community-level achievement unlocks**. A Community of Interest that achieves sufficient EarnedPath progression across its FAVORS-enrolled members earns the right to issue SROCs of increasing value and scope. The gamification layer ensures that:

- SROC issuance is tied to demonstrated community learning and alignment (not merely economic activity)
- Community members understand the relationship between their individual resonance (ARI) and their community's collective SROC value
- Emergency Room activations are visible to all community members through PlayNAC dashboards, creating shared awareness and collective response

The EarnedPath formula (EP = CPM × WBS + PERT) applies to community-level SROC progression: a community's SROC issuance capacity advances along a critical path that requires both demonstrated ecological alignment (CPM) and completed social contribution milestones (WBS), adjusted for resilience and risk (PERT).

## Part VI: Communities of Interest — Implementation Guide

### 6.1 Who Qualifies as a Community of Interest

A Community of Interest eligible to participate in the SROC framework is any collective that:

- Comprises two or more FAVORS-enrollable human beings
- Shares a defined geographic, ecological, or social commons
- Acknowledges the ERES Triune (Rights, Roles, Rules) as its governance foundation
- Commits to ARI/ERI measurement transparency through REEPER
- Registers its CBGMOD stakeholder structure (identifying its Citizen, Business, Government, Military, Ombudsman, and Dignitary participants)

Communities of Interest may include — but are not limited to: residential neighborhoods, cooperative businesses, municipal districts, tribal nations, academic institutions, ecological stewardship organizations, intentional communities, and inter-organizational coalitions.

### 6.2 Entry Requirements

| Requirement | Module | Method |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Biometric enrollment of core members | FAVORS | Kirlianographic + retinal + fingerprint scan |
| ARI baseline establishment | REEPER | Minimum 30-cycle Kirlianographic measurement period |
| ERI baseline establishment | SECUIR | GSSG sensor network integration or equivalent |
| CBGMOD stakeholder mapping | CBGMOD | Community of Interest charter filing |
| UBIMIA Account activation | UBIMIA | GraceChain wallet creation per enrolled member |
| PlayNAC Community Registration | PlayNAC | Community profile and EarnedPath initialization |

### 6.3 SROC Tiers for Communities of Interest

SROC instruments are tiered by community scale, measured in total enrolled FAVORS participants and aggregate SBEU:

| Tier | Community Scale | SROC Scope | Governance Requirement |
|------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Seed** | 2–25 members | Local ecological micro-offset | Ombudsman + 2 Dignitaries |
| **Root** | 26–250 members | Neighborhood / cooperative scale | Full CBGMOD representation |
| **Branch** | 251–2,500 members | Municipal district scale | SOMT + ECVS governance active |
| **Canopy** | 2,501–25,000 members | Regional scale | GERP integration required |
| **Grove** | 25,001+ members | Continental / planetary scale | Full VECTOR loop required |

Each tier unlocks additional SROC issuance capacity, PlayNAC quest access, UBIMIA incentive pools, and GERP resource planning integration.

### 6.4 Community System Comments

Every Community of Interest maintains a living **System Comments Record** — a permanent, GraceChain-archived log of SROC-related observations, anomalies, corrections, and evolutions. System Comments are generated:

- Automatically by REEPER monitoring cycles
- Manually by the Ombudsman class during dispute resolution
- Through PlayNAC community governance quests
- At each SROC issuance, adjustment, exchange, and retirement event

The System Comments Record is the community's institutional memory and its primary input to the ERES 1000-Year Future Map. It is the mechanism through which a Community of Interest contributes to civilizational knowledge across generations.

## Part VII: Relationship to the Social Bio-Ecologic Economy

SROC is the primary contractual instrument of the **Social Bio-Ecologic Economy** — the economic paradigm operationalized through the REEPER-UBIMIA integration within VECTOR.

The three dimensions of the Social Bio-Ecologic Economy map directly onto SROC's structure:

**Social Dimension:**  
SROC recognizes that community-building, caregiving, knowledge-sharing, and civic participation generate real ecological offset value. Legacy carbon markets cannot see this. SROC can — because its measurement apparatus (FAVORS biometrics, REEPER monitoring, PlayNAC EarnedPath) captures social contribution at the individual and community level and translates it into SBEU.

**Biological Dimension:**  
SROC's ARI weighting means that the biological health of a community's members is directly reflected in its economic value. A community whose members have high biometric coherence (measured through Kirlianographic Aura signatures) holds SROC instruments of greater value. This creates a direct economic incentive for community health — not as a policy goal but as a market outcome within the resonance-aligned economy.

**Ecologic Dimension:**  
SROC's ERI weighting ensures that ecological alignment is not an externality — it is the primary determinant of contract value. A community that reduces its emissions, restores its local ecosystem, and maintains SECUIR-compatible energy infrastructure holds SROC instruments that appreciate over time. A community that degrades its ecology holds instruments that depreciate — automatically, without administrative intervention.
