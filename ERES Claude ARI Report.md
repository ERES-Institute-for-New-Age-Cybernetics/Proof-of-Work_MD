# **ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics: Aura Resonance Index Report**

## **Executive Summary**

The ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics has developed the Aura Resonance Index (ARI) as a comprehensive biometric resonance integration system that quantifies human-environment coherence. This report examines both the theoretical framework and the practical implementation strategy for ARI, which serves as the resonance kernel of the PlayNAC-EP-GERP triad within ERES's broader Bio-Ecologic Economy infrastructure.

The ARI system has evolved from conceptual consciousness research into a viable, evidence-based platform that combines validated sensors and algorithms for real-world applications in healthcare, workplace wellness, and community planning.

## **About ERES Institute**

The ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics, founded by Joseph A. Sprute (ERES Maestro), focuses on creating integrated systems that bridge cybernetic technology with consciousness research, ecological sustainability, and social justice. The institute's mission centers on developing a Global Actuary Investor Authority using game theory and evidence-based approaches to create sustainable community frameworks.

## **Aura Resonance Index: Core Architecture**

### **Theoretical Foundation**

The ARI operates on the fundamental principle that personal aura, ecological balance, and justice harmonize to shape individual and collective outcomes. The system integrates bio-electric signatures, socio-economic metrics, and ecological cycles into a unified resonance measurement framework.

**Core Formula:**

ARI \= f(Personal Aura × Ecological Balance × Justice Harmony)

This formula encompasses biometric coherence, environmental factors, social dynamics, and temporal alignment to produce a comprehensive resonance score.

### **Foundational Rules**

1. Don't hurt yourself  
2. Don't hurt others

These principles anchor all ARI applications within an ethical framework prioritizing non-punitive, regenerative outcomes.
