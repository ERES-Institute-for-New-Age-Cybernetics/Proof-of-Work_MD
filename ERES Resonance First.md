#### Abstract

The ongoing detection of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and theoretical advances in interstellar travel necessitate a shift in the protocol for Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI). Current METI debates often center on the abstract broadcast of information without a defined recipient. This paper proposes a contingency framework for a scenario where a non-human intelligence (NHI) is inferred via the detection of an anomalous object or signal with apparent artificial origin. We argue for a move from open-ended philosophical messaging to a closed-loop, tiered testing protocol. This protocol is designed to: 1\) Confirm the artificial nature of the phenomenon, 2\) Establish a basic communicative framework using universal scientific concepts, and 3\) Implement a strategic filter to gauge intent and capability for coherent interaction before any escalation. This method prioritizes information gathering and risk mitigation over declarative transmission.

#### 1\. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift from Active METI to Responsive Dialogue

The foundational principles of traditional METI, such as the Arecibo message, were crafted as purposeful broadcasts into the galaxy with no specific target or expectation of a timely response. The hypothetical detection of an object of potential non-human origin within or approaching our solar system fundamentally alters this paradigm. The question is no longer *"Should we shout into the void?"* but rather *"How do we respond to a knock at the door?"*  
This scenario demands a rigorous, scientific, and safety-oriented protocol that can be ratified by the international scientific community *before* such an event occurs. The proposed framework below is designed for this specific context.

#### 2\. Core Strategic Principle: The Communication Filter

The central thesis of this framework is that the initial communicative act must serve as a test. The content of the message is designed to filter respondents based on their ability to understand universal scientific concepts and their willingness to engage in a coherent, non-hostile exchange.

* Successful Decoding: A response that accurately builds upon the transmitted information indicates a shared cognitive framework based on a logical understanding of the universe. This suggests the potential for more complex dialogue and aligns with the goal of finding "those who can understand us."  
* Recognized Disconnect: A response that is incoherent, aggressive, or demonstrates a fundamental misinterpretation of the message signals a dangerous disconnect in perception, intent, or morality. This triggers a pre-defined contingency plan to disengage from active transmission and shift to passive observation and analysis.

#### 3\. Proposed Tiered Communication Protocol

The protocol is structured in sequential, escalating tiers. Advancement to a higher tier is only permitted upon receiving a response that passes the filter of the previous tier.  
Tier 0: Phenomenon Detection & Analysis (Pre-Communication)

* Action: Rigorous data collection on the object (e.g., trajectory, spectral signature, emissive properties, dynamics). All potential informational content (e.g., modulated emissions) is analyzed for patterns.  
* Goal: To achieve a high degree of confidence that the object's behavior is inconsistent with any known natural phenomenon and is likely artificial.

Tier 1: The Universal Primer (The "Ping")

* Action: Targeted transmission of the most fundamental, universal concepts.  
  * Prime number sequences (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...).  
  * Fundamental physical constants (e.g., the hydrogen line frequency, 1.42 GHz; the fine-structure constant).  
  * Basic geometric shapes encoded in binary or bitmap.  
* Goal: Elicit *any* patterned response—a mirrored sequence, a pause, a change in state—to confirm the object is not only artificial but is aware of and capable of responding to communication attempts.

Tier 2: The Contextual & Strategic Filter (The "Test")

* Action: Upon confirmation from Tier 1, transmit a more complex packet. This packet is the core of the strategic filter and consists of two parts:  
  1. The "We Are" Statement: A updated, optimized version of a "Arecibo 2.0" message, providing our location in the solar system using pulsar maps, atomic numbers of life-critical elements, and a representation of human form.  
  2. The "We Observe You" Statement: This is the critical innovation. The message includes data about the object itself: its observed trajectory, its emission spectrum, its velocity. This demonstrates advanced sensory capability and contextual awareness.  
* Goal: To filter for intelligence and intent. A successful response corrects, confirms, or builds upon this contextual data (e.g., transmitting its origin point, stating its purpose). This indicates a shared reality and a potential for alignment. A failed response—hostility, nonsense, or ignorance of the contextual data—triggers the contingency plan.

Tier 3: Cautious Escalation (The "Dialogue")

* Action: Only initiated after successful passage through Tier 2\. Communication can carefully escalate to more complex ideas, including mathematics, physics, and eventually, more abstract concepts like the philosophical constructs of consciousness and ethics (e.g., the "Prime Directive" of non-interference previously proposed).  
* Goal: To establish a sustainable dialogue and information exchange with a proven coherent actor.

#### 4\. Contingency Plan: The "Disconnect" Protocol

A failure at any tier (e.g., no response, aggressive response, incoherent response) must trigger a global, pre-coordinated contingency plan:

1. Cessation: Immediate halt of all active, directed transmission towards the phenomenon.  
2. Analysis: Full focus shifts to passive observation, data analysis, and threat assessment by the international scientific and security community.  
3. Strategic Silence: The default state returns to passive listening (SETI) unless new data justifies re-initiation of the protocol under a new consensus.

#### 5\. Conclusion and Call to Collaboration

The detection of an anomalous object demands a response that is scientific, strategic, and safe. This proposed framework provides a concrete, actionable plan that replaces philosophical speculation with a testable, iterative protocol. It is designed to maximize information gain while minimizing potential risk by implementing a clear filter for response.  
This paper is intended as a starting point for collaboration. We call upon the SETI, METI, astrophysics, and xenolinguistics communities to:

* Debate and refine the content of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 messages.  
* Establish international consensus on the decision-making process for advancing through tiers.  
* Formally adopt a version of this contingency plan to ensure humanity is prepared to respond wisely to first contact.

### Credits and Acknowledgments

The author would like to acknowledge the foundational work of the broader SETI and METI scientific communities, whose decades of research make this kind of strategic discussion possible. Specific intellectual debt is owed to the pioneers who first grappled with the problem of universal communication, including:

* Dr. Frank Drake (1930–2022), for the Drake Equation and the first modern METI message (Arecibo, 1974).  
* Dr. Carl Sagan (1934–1996), for his profound work on the Voyager Golden Record and his efforts to popularize and philosophically contextualize the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.  
* Dr. Douglas Vakoch, President of METI International, for his continued advocacy and research into the semiotic and psychological dimensions of composing interstellar messages.  
* The members of the ICETI (International Committee for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and similar groups working to establish professional and ethical guidelines for post-detection scenarios.

This paper was developed through discussion and debate within online scientific forums, highlighting the value of collaborative, open-source analysis for frontier science problems.
