## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The PBJ Tri-Codex represents a comprehensive measurement framework for evaluating human contribution, ecological health, and justice systems through three integrated rating systems:

- **PERC** - Personal Emission Resonance Codex
- **BERC** - Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex  
- **JERC** - Justice Evaluation Resource Codex

Each codex includes ROI (Return on Investment) metrics that measure regenerative impact versus extractive cost across personal, ecological, and social dimensions.
