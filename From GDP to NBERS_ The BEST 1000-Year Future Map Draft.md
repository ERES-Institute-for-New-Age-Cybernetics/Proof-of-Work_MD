# **From GDP to NBERS: The BEST 1000-Year Future Map Draft**

## **Abstract**

This paper proposes a transition from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (NBERS) as the fundamental measure of prosperity. It presents a 1,000-year roadmap for building a Bio-Ecologic Economy grounded in empirical measurement, resonance feedback, and intergenerational stewardship. The framework integrates Emotional Personal IQ Real and Quantum (EPIR-Q), Aura Resonance Index (ARI), the Sovereign Universal Glycan Architecture for Resilience (SUGAR), Bio-Electric Signature Time (BEST), and EarnedPath (EP) as core indices. These are coupled with governance structures (CBGMODD and P³), learning and simulation systems (Empirical Realtime Education System and PlayNAC), and certification protocols (TETRA CERT). Together, they form a comprehensive design for moving civilization away from extractive models toward health, law, protection, skills-trade, and wellness as the standards of economic value.

## **1\. Introduction**

For centuries, nations have used Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the dominant measure of economic health. Yet GDP rewards extraction, overproduction, and consumption while ignoring the depletion of ecological systems and the erosion of social wellness. This has led to cycles of crisis, inequality, and ecological collapse.

This paper argues for a fundamental reorientation: replacing GDP with the **National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (NBERS)**. NBERS measures prosperity not by production but by balance, wellness, and sustainability. It is the cornerstone of what we call the **BEST 1000-Year Future Map**.

The BEST framework integrates a set of empirical systems designed by the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics. These include:

* **EPIR-Q**: Emotional Personal IQ Real and Quantum

* **ARI**: Aura Resonance Index

* **SUGAR**: Sovereign Universal Glycan Architecture for Resilience

* **BEST**: Bio-Electric Signature Time, enabling Biometric Checkout through six measurable markers

* **EP**: EarnedPath, a pillar of ERES that accounts for time, merit, and service

* **PlayNAC**: New Age Cybernetic Game Theory, enabling non-punitive simulation

* **ERES EP**: Empirical Realtime Education System, aligning learning with resonance

* **TETRA CERT**: A certification system linking Education, Desire, and SPRT to Health, Law, Protection, and Skills-Trade

## **2\. Core Variables**

### **2.1 EPIR-Q**

EPIR-Q captures intelligence in both real and quantum dimensions, transforming emotional, personal, and collective qualities into measurable indices. It operationalizes **P³ (Personal, Public, Private) × Artificial Intelligence \+ Sustainability**. In practice, EPIR-Q allows values such as trust, empathy, and integrity to be quantified and linked directly into planning and policy.

### **2.2 ARI**

The Aura Resonance Index measures the resonance of human actions within social and ecological systems. It integrates biometric signals (heart rate variability, electrodermal response, sensory duration) and interprets clarity, persistence, and intensity of influence. ARI provides the counterpoint to EPIR-Q, ensuring that what people intend is aligned with the resonance they produce.

### **2.3 SUGAR**

The **Sovereign Universal Glycan Architecture for Resilience** is the biochemical and cybernetic substrate of the Bio-Ecologic Economy.

* **Biological Foundation:** Uses glycobiology, glucose, and glycan codes to regulate metabolism, immunity, and microbiome balance.

* **Cybernetic and Semantic Layer:** Establishes programmable protocols; applies the “law \= wall” principle equating abstract law with physical enforcement.

* **Distributed Architecture:** Organizes resilience through circles of influence, micro-factories, semantic AI nodes, and renewable energy micro-grids.

* **Strategic Role:** Anchors personalized medicine, integrates resource and resonance scores (PERC, BERC, JERC, NBERS), and supports planetary defense.

### **2.4 NBERS**

The **National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score** replaces GDP as the primary economic measure. NBERS quantifies ecological wellness, human health, and social equity. It underpins the **99/1 CARE Economy**, where the focus shifts from concentrated wealth to collective well-being. NBERS is the empirical signal of whether society is in balance or imbalance.

### **2.5 CBGMODD and P³**

Governance is structured through **Citizen, Business, Government, Military, Ombudsman, Dignitary, and Diplomat (CBGMODD)**. This structure gains coherence through **P³: Personal, Public, Private**, ensuring accountability at every level. The framework is empirically grounded in six biometric markers—fingerprint, aura, voice, odor, retina, and signature—called the **6 Degrees of Separation**, which secure identity and trust across civic and economic life.

### **2.6 BEST: Bio-Electric Signature Time**

BEST defines the biometric foundation of participation in the economy. The six markers listed above provide secure **Biometric Checkout** for civic transactions, education, and trade. BEST does not only track chronological time but the **time of contribution, resonance, and impact**, ensuring that actions align with ecological and social outcomes.

### **2.7 EarnedPath (EP)**

EarnedPath is one of the core pillars of ERES. It accounts for how contributions are made and sustained over time. EP tracks service, learning, ecological action, and remediation, assigning merit that influences access to resources, privileges, and responsibilities. EP integrates directly with PlayNAC and the Empirical Realtime Education System to ensure that individuals learn and earn simultaneously, and that contribution replaces extraction as the basis of value.

## **3\. Learning, Simulation, and Certification**

### **3.1 Empirical Realtime Education System (ERES EP)**

Education is continuous, adaptive, and empirical. Biometric signals and resonance indices provide real-time feedback on alignment with ecological and social goals. Learning is no longer abstract; it is experiential and tied directly to outcomes.

### **3.2 PlayNAC: New Age Cybernetic Game Theory**

PlayNAC simulates societal and ecological outcomes, allowing individuals and institutions to experience the consequences of their actions in safe, game-based environments. Merit is earned through alignment with long-term wellness and sustainability. Failures lead to remediation, not punishment. PlayNAC ensures that the principles of the Bio-Ecologic Economy are understood, practiced, and reinforced through participation.

### **3.3 TETRA CERT Framework**

TETRA CERT stands for **Transparent, Empirical, Trusted, Regenerative, and Accountable Certification**. It validates the pillars of Education, Desire, and SPRT by grounding them in four practical domains:

* **Education → Health**: Ensures all citizens are trained in sustaining personal and planetary wellness.

* **Desire → Law**: Aligns personal and economic desires with lawful, resonance-based frameworks.

* **SPRT → Protection and Skills-Trade**: Prepares citizens with emergency, mediation, ecological, and cyber skills while making skills transferable across the economy.

* **Certification → Accountability**: Every participant is verified and validated as contributing to health, law, protection, and skills-trade.

## **4\. Implementation Phases**

### **Phase I: Foundation (Years 0–200)**

* Establish baselines for EPIR-Q, ARI, BEST, EarnedPath, and NBERS.

* Deploy SUGAR protocols at biological and cybernetic layers.

* Launch ERES EP and PlayNAC at community levels.

* Begin shifting policy from GDP to NBERS.

### **Phase II: Expansion (Years 200–600)**

* Scale SUGAR into distributed global networks.

* Institutionalize CBGMODD governance tied to P³ accountability.

* Expand PlayNAC and ERES EP into universal civic education.

* Apply NBERS as the primary global metric for trade, policy, and remediation.

### **Phase III: Flourish (Years 600–1000)**

* Achieve resonance between personal, social, and ecological systems.

* Replace GDP entirely with NBERS as the constitution of economic governance.

* Extend governance and resonance systems into orbital and interplanetary habitats.

* Institutionalize wellness, health, and contribution as the measures of success.

## **5\. Conclusion**

The shift from GDP to NBERS is more than a change of measurement. It represents the redesign of civilization from extraction to resonance. EPIR-Q, ARI, SUGAR, BEST, and EarnedPath provide the indices for human and ecological balance. CBGMODD and P³ provide governance clarity. PlayNAC and the Empirical Realtime Education System provide the simulation and learning environment. TETRA CERT ensures accountability in health, law, protection, and skills-trade. Together, they create a thousand-year roadmap for a sustainable and equitable Bio-Ecologic Economy.
