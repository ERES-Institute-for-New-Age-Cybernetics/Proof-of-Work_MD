`## Preamble`  
`We, the custodians of knowledge and care for this world, proclaim this Declaration to anchor a vision that will serve humanity, the biosphere, and all generations yet to come.`

`Our time is not the end, nor the beginning, but a turning point. The tools of technology, the wisdom of nature, and the spirit of cooperation must be united into a living system — one that will outlast wars, outlast fashions, and outlast our own lifetimes.`

`---`

`## Core Principles`

`1. **Do Not Harm Yourself**`    
   `Nurture your own mind, body, and spirit as a vessel for the greater good.`

`2. **Do Not Harm Others**`    
   `Act with empathy, respect, and non-punitive resolution in all matters.`

`3. **Honor the Earth**`    
   `Treat the biosphere as a living partner, not a resource to be consumed without renewal.`

`4. **Share in Resonance**`    
   `Build systems where knowledge, merit, and resources circulate equitably.`

`5. **Plan for a Thousand Years**`    
   `Make decisions that strengthen the next century, not just the next quarter.`

`## Commitments to Action`

`We commit to:`    
`- **Preserve** the frameworks of New Age Cybernetics (NAC) — including PERC, PlayNAC, SECUIR, and the 1000-Year Future Map — in permanent, public archives both digital and physical.`    
`- **Implement** pilot communities where EarnedPath education, Graceful Contribution Formula (GCF) economies, and Smart Shelter systems can thrive.`    
`- **Maintain** the ERES Generational Trust to ensure this work is funded without interruption.`    
`- **Educate** through open, multilingual archives accessible to any human, in any era.`    
`- **Invite** all people to participate as co-authors of humanity’s future.`

`## Generational Clause`

`If ever the line of stewardship is broken, let this document be the seed to grow it anew.`
