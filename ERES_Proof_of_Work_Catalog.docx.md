**DEFINITIONAL FRAMEWORK**

*Each category constitutes a distinct ontological domain. Documents are assigned by primary function, not surface topic.*

|  | ONE-GOOD (Marriage) — Resonant Union Documents in this section embody the principle of generative binding: the philosophical, ecological, social, and temporal acts of co-creation that produce civilizational good. "Marriage" here is not ceremonial but ontological — the coupling of elements (human \+ ecological, individual \+ community, present \+ future) into a coherent, self-sustaining whole. These works define what ERES is for: the positive telos, the end-state of resonance, the good toward which all other systems are oriented. They answer the question: What are we building together, and why does it matter? |
| :---- | :---- |

|  | SECURITY-CLEARANCE (Sovereignty) — Verified Authority Documents in this section constitute the institutional and operational layer of verifiable legitimacy. "Security-Clearance" signifies the formal establishment of who has authority to act, what structures govern action, and how institutional sovereignty is asserted and maintained. "Sovereignty" here is not territorial but informational and institutional — the right to define, govern, and execute within the ERES framework. These works answer: Who are we, what authority do we hold, and by what structure do we operate? They include governance charters, architectural mandates, energy sovereignty, migration protocols, credentialing systems, and outreach to external powers. |
| :---- | :---- |

|  | DATA-INTEGRITY (Terrorism) — Defense Against Corruption Documents in this section form the adversarial defense layer: systems designed to detect, classify, and neutralize corruption within the ERES data environment. "Terrorism" in NAC terminology refers not only to external attack but to any force — intentional or entropic — that corrupts resonance data, falsifies biometric records, manipulates contribution scores, or compromises cryptographic chain-of-custody. This section contains the technical codebases, validation protocols, classification frameworks, cryptographic anchoring, and threat taxonomies that protect the integrity of the entire system. These works answer: What threatens our data, and how do we prove it remains uncorrupted? |

| 🤝  SECTION I — ONE-GOOD (Marriage) *Resonant Union · Generative Co-Creation · Civilizational Telos* |
| :---: |

These documents define what ERES is building toward. They are the affirmative declaration of good — the philosophical ground, ecological commitments, peace frameworks, community care models, and long-horizon future maps that constitute the marriage of humanity with itself and with Earth. They are the "why" made manifest.
