## **Professional Experience**

### **Co-Founder & ERES Maestro – *ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics* (2012–Present)**

* Pioneered New Age Cybernetics (NAC), combining bio-energetics, cybernetic governance, and long-term ecological strategy.

* Developed core systems: **EarnedPath (EP)**, **PlayNAC Game Theory**, **PERC / BERC / JERC**, and **SMART-City frameworks** such as **VERTECA**.

* Published \> 200 frameworks, white papers, and technical articles on ResearchGate and Medium.

* Designed methodologies for non-punitive remediation, sociocratic decision systems, and smart-city governance rooted in energy dynamics.

* Built and maintained the **PlayNAC-KERNEL** open-source project, targeted at VR/AR governance interfaces and real-time decision support. [ResearchGate+3Medium+3ResearchGate+3](https://medium.com/%40josephasprute/eres-institute-executive-summary-1c1500a8ec38?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **Freelance ICT Consultant & Systems Designer – *Self-Employed* (1990s–2012)**

* Provided tech strategy, CRM design, and cyber-security consultation for SMEs, NGOs, and government clients.

* Developed early trusted network systems (e.g., “TVPN” Trusted Virtual Private Network concept).

* Designed planning methodologies and “C-Structurel” community frameworks for scalable eco-communities (“Gunnysack Earthship Model”). [ERES Maestro+1](https://earnedpath.wordpress.com/about/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
