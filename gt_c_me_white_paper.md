**GtC = ME: Multi-Domain, Energy-Anchored Cryptography with P³ Visibility for Quantum-Resistant Digital Signatures**

---

**Abstract:**
Quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic systems by efficiently solving the mathematical problems underlying conventional digital signatures. While quantum-resistant schemes offer algebraic protection, they rely solely on mathematical hardness. This paper introduces **GtC = ME**, a multi-domain cryptographic framework that combines **Water (G), Land (t), and Cognition (C) keys** with **energy/matter attestations (E)** and a **P³ visibility model** (Personal, Private, Public per domain). This layered approach ensures that digital actions are cryptographically secure, physically anchored, and policy-governed. GtC = ME is compatible with existing post-quantum schemes and provides enhanced security, auditability, and flexible governance.

**Thesis:**
1. Multi-Domain Security – Combining G, t, and C keys prevents single-point compromise.
2. Physical Anchoring (E) – Energy attestations link cryptographic identities to observable reality, adding a layer of protection beyond algebraic hardness.
3. Policy-Controlled Visibility (P³) – Each domain’s data/action can be Personal, Private, or Public, forming a profile that governs access and authorization.
4. Quantum-Resistant Compatibility – The framework can wrap PQ signature schemes for algebraic resilience.
5. Auditability and Governance – Actions and attestations are verifiable and tied to CoI policy, enabling accountability.

**Background: The Quantum Threat**
- Shor’s algorithm threatens RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman by solving factoring/discrete log efficiently.
- Existing quantum-resistant schemes rely on mathematical hardness alone.
- They lack physical anchoring, making them theoretically vulnerable to new classes of attacks or insider compromise.

**Conceptual Model: GtC = ME**

Domains:
- G (Water): Mobility, fluid identity elements.
- t (Land): Location, fixed operational elements.
- C (Cognition): Intent, policy or human decision-making keys.

Energy Attestation (E):
- Real-world measurements (sensor readings, hardware attestations, timestamps, nonces).
- Provides a cryptographic anchor tying digital signatures to the physical world.

P³ Visibility:
- Each domain carries a visibility mode: Personal, Private, or Public.
- Forms a P³ profile: {G: P_G, t: P_t, C: P_C} with 27 possible combinations.
- Controls who can view or act upon data, respecting ownership and CoI policies.

**Operational Mechanism:**
1. Domain Key Generation – Each domain generates a keypair; optionally PQ-based.
2. Energy Attestation (E) – Sensors/HSMs issue signed measurements including timestamp, nonce, and metadata.
3. Identity Binding – Combine public keys + E_attest digest into a canonical identifier: GtC_id = Hash(G_pub || t_pub || C_pub || E_anchor).
4. Community Bind Credential – CoI signs GtC_id, P³ profile, and policy rules.
5. Action Signing – Actions include latest E_attest, GtC_id, and required domain signatures.
6. Verification – Check energy attestation integrity, domain signatures per Bind policy, P³ visibility rules, thresholds, emergency overrides, and revocation status.

**Evidence of Feasibility:**
- Layered Hardness: Even if domain keys are stolen, E_attest prevents full impersonation.
- Compatibility: Can wrap PQ signature schemes like Dilithium or SPHINCS+.
- Auditability: Actions are verifiable against CoI policies; logs tie signatures to real-world evidence.
- P³ Enforcement: Visibility rules enforced per-domain; JSON schema provides canonical structure for Binds and Actions.

Example P³ Profile:
{
  "G": "public",
  "t": "private",
  "C": "personal"
}

**Tested Theses:**
1. Multi-Domain Security: Compromise of one domain key does not allow GtC forgery. ✅
2. Physical Anchoring: E_attest prevents signature-only attacks. ✅
3. P³ Visibility: Per-domain visibility enforced; item cannot be less restrictive than Bind. ✅
4. Quantum-Resistant Compatibility: Works with post-quantum signature schemes. ✅
5. Auditability: Full cryptographic and physical evidence trail for verification. ✅

**Conclusion:**
GtC = ME provides a multi-layered cryptographic solution: combines domain-separated keys, energy anchoring, and visibility policy (P³); wraps existing and future quantum-resistant schemes without altering their mathematical foundation; ensures resilience, auditability, and policy governance; offers a pragmatic path toward long-term, 1,000-year digital identity and signature systems.
