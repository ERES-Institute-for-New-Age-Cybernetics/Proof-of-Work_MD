# PLANETARY EMERGENCY DECLARATION
## Preventing the 6th Mass Extinction: A Systems-Level Response to Converging Crises

**Prepared by:** Joseph A. Sprute, Founder & Director, ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics  
**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Classification:** URGENT - CIVILIZATIONAL CRISIS  
**Distribution:** World Leaders, UN Security Council, Scientific Community, Global Public

---

## THE ALARM

This is not another climate report. This is a declaration that Earth's life-support systems are approaching critical thresholds—and that humanity possesses, for the first time in history, both the responsibility for the crisis **and the technical capacity to prevent total collapse**.

The scientific evidence is clear:

- Current vertebrate extinction rates are **100 to 1,000 times higher** than natural background rates
- **40,000+ species** are currently threatened with extinction (IUCN Red List, 2025)
- **28% of all assessed species** face imminent extinction risk
- Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting at **36 km/year** toward Siberia (NOAA, January 2025)
- The South Atlantic Anomaly is **growing 8% annually**, weakening Earth's radiation protection

Unlike the previous five mass extinctions caused by asteroids, supervolcanoes, or ice ages, **this extinction event is being caused by a single species—us—and therefore can be prevented by us**.

But prevention requires immediate, coordinated, systems-level intervention. Individual nations acting independently cannot solve planetary-scale crises. We need integrated infrastructure that treats Earth as the unified system it is.

## THREE CONVERGING CATASTROPHES

### 1. GEOMAGNETIC DESTABILIZATION

**Current Status (NOAA WMM2025, January 2025):**
- Magnetic north pole moving at 36 km/year (down from 55 km/year peak, but still historically unprecedented)
- South Atlantic Anomaly expanding 8% per year
- Magnetic blackout zones near poles expanding, affecting navigation and communication
- No imminent pole reversal expected, but unprecedented deceleration suggests unpredictable core dynamics

**The Cascading Risk:**
Even without full reversal, continued weakening creates:
- Increased solar radiation penetration → atmospheric chemistry changes
- Satellite damage and navigation system failures
- Potential trigger for rapid climate feedback loops
- Agricultural disruption from cosmic ray-induced cloud formation changes

### 2. BIODIVERSITY COLLAPSE

**Current Status (Verified Scientific Data):**
- Extinction rate: 100-1,000x natural background rate (Science Advances, 2015)
- 40,084 species threatened with extinction (IUCN, 2025)
- 1% of land species have gone extinct since 1800-1900
- Recent study (Royal Society, October 2025) shows extinction rates peaked ~100 years ago but **current habitat destruction threatens acceleration**

**Critical Context:**
While documented extinction rates have slowed due to conservation efforts, **habitat loss continues accelerating**. Past extinctions were primarily island species affected by invasive species; **current threats are continental habitat destruction and climate change**—fundamentally different drivers requiring different solutions.

The threat profile has shifted from isolated populations to entire ecosystems.

### 3. CASCADING SYSTEMS FAILURE

These crises are not separate. They form interconnected positive feedback loops:

- Magnetic weakening → increased cosmic radiation → atmospheric chemistry changes → climate acceleration
- Climate destabilization → ecosystem collapse → reduced CO2 sequestration → further warming
- Biodiversity loss → soil degradation → agricultural collapse → mass migration → resource conflict
- Habitat destruction → species loss → ecosystem service collapse → human vulnerability increases

**The Pattern:** Each crisis amplifies the others. Addressing them individually fails because the **system** is failing.

---

## WHY CURRENT APPROACHES ARE INADEQUATE

### Paris Agreement (2015)
- Target: Limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
- Reality: Current policies track toward 2.4-2.7°C by 2100 (Climate Action Tracker, 2025)
- **Problem:** Voluntary national commitments without coordination mechanisms or enforcement

### UN Sustainable Development Goals (2015)
- Target: 17 goals by 2030
- Reality: Only 12-15% of targets on track (UN SDG Report 2024)
- **Problem:** Individual goals treated separately; no systems integration

### Current Conservation Efforts
Conservation works—extinction rates have declined from their peak 100 years ago precisely because of protection efforts. However:
- **Scale mismatch:** Protecting individual species while habitat destruction continues
- **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ conservation organizations operating independently
- **Funding gap:** $600-800 billion annual shortfall for adequate protection (Deutz et al., 2020)
- **No coordination infrastructure:** Cannot respond to planetary-scale threats

### The Fatal Flaw

**All current approaches treat Earth's systems as separate problems to be solved independently. This cannot work because Earth is a single integrated system.**

Analogy: Treating a patient's heart, lungs, and kidneys with separate, uncoordinated medical teams. Each team optimizes their organ while the patient dies of systemic failure.

What we need: **Integrated planetary infrastructure that coordinates life-support systems the way a hospital ICU coordinates patient care.**

---

## THE ERES SOLUTION: PLANETARY ICU INFRASTRUCTURE

The ERES Institute has developed comprehensive frameworks for **planetary-scale coordination** that address all three crises simultaneously through integrated smart infrastructure.

### Core Principle

**Don't fight individual symptoms. Rebuild Earth's immune system.**

Create distributed networks of self-sustaining ecosystems (Massive Nature Domes/Smart Cities) that:
1. Preserve biodiversity and genetic diversity
2. Generate clean energy and measure bio-energetic health
3. Coordinate as unified planetary system via GSSG (Global Smart Smart Grid)
4. Provide refuge if correction fails while actively working to correct

---

## THE ENGINEERING REALITY: SAND, STRUCTURES, AND SOLAR

### Why SAND Is the Foundation

Earth's most abundant accessible resource is **sand**. Desert regions contain effectively unlimited building material for planetary-scale infrastructure. The question is not availability—it's logistics and energy.

**The SAND Advantage:**
- **Abundance:** Deserts cover ~33% of land surface (48 million km²)
- **Structural properties:** Silica can be fused using concentrated solar (no fossil fuels needed)
- **Local sourcing:** Every region has sand; minimizes transport
- **Fusion technique:** Solar furnaces create glass/ceramic structures stronger than concrete
- **Zero carbon:** Pure solar energy + raw material = no fossil fuel dependency

**The Critical Measurement:**
Moving and processing sand at planetary scale requires:
- Precise energy calculations (MJ per ton per kilometer)
- Bio-energetic impact assessments (desert ecosystem preservation)
- Real-time BERA monitoring to ensure we're healing, not harming
- Mathematical certainty: Every joule spent on construction must be solar-derived

### GSSG Super-Structures: The Actual Physical Infrastructure

These aren't conceptual "eco-villages." These are **mega-engineered structures** built from fused sand/silica using concentrated solar energy:

**Design Specifications:**
- **Scale:** 1-10 km diameter domes (city-scale, not building-scale)
- **Material:** Solar-fused silica glass with embedded photovoltaic surfaces
- **Structure:** Geodesic/tetrahedral architecture for maximum strength-to-weight
- **Height:** 200-500 meters (sufficient for complete climate control + vertical agriculture)
- **Population capacity:** 50,000-500,000 per installation
- **Energy generation:** Entire surface is photovoltaic—structures ARE the solar farms

**The Scalability Architecture:**

*Phase 1 - Ground Installations (Years 1-10):*
- Anchored mega-structures with deep foundation
- Complete biosphere enclosure
- Serve as Species Preservation Arks + human habitat
- Generate 10-100x more energy than consumed (export to grid)

*Phase 2 - Mobile Structures (Years 10-30):*
- Same design, but with mobility systems
- Can relocate in response to climate events
- Track optimal solar exposure
- Coordinate movement via GSSG for planetary rebalancing

*Phase 3 - Orbital Capability (Years 30-100):*
- Structures designed from inception with eventual space capability
- As technology advances, retrofit for electromagnetic launch
- Tetrahedral structures can become modular space stations
- **Ultimate goal:** Self-sustaining biosphere modules that can leave planetary surface if necessary

**Why This Works:**
The structures scale continuously from "storm shelter" → "city" → "mobile city" → "space-capable ark." Same basic architecture, progressive capability additions.

### Moving SAND: The Logistics Problem Solved by Solar

**The Challenge:**
Moving billions of tons of sand to construction sites seems impossible using current fossil fuel logistics.

**The ERES Solution:**
1. **Build where the sand is** - Major installations in desert regions initially
2. **Solar-powered rail** - Construct dedicated solar-powered rail networks using sand itself
3. **Energy cascade** - First installation generates power for second, second powers third, etc.
4. **Automated systems** - Robotic construction powered by solar (no human labor exploitation)

**The Mathematics:**
- Moving 1 ton of sand 100 km requires ~0.1 MJ energy (rail efficiency)
- One 5 km² installation generates ~5,000 MW continuous solar
- That powers movement of ~50,000 tons per hour
- **Result:** Each completed structure powers construction of the next faster than the first

**Critical Measurement Standards:**
- Track energy input vs. output for every structure (must be net-positive)
- Monitor ecosystem impact in real-time via BERA
- Verify every ton of sand sourced doesn't disrupt existing ecosystems
- **Zero tolerance for environmental harm during construction**

### SOLAR REPLACING FOSSIL FUELS: The Species Example

This is where ERES becomes humanity's proof-of-concept for planetary maturity.

**Current Energy Reality:**
- Global energy: ~580 EJ/year (2024)
- ~80% from fossil fuels (464 EJ from carbon)
- Solar hitting Earth's surface: ~3,850,000 EJ/year
- **We need to capture 0.015% of incident solar to replace all fossil fuels**

**GSSG Super-Structures Solve This:**
- Each 5 km diameter dome = ~20 km² photovoltaic surface
- At 25% efficiency = ~5,000 MW continuous average power
- 1,000 installations = 5 TW continuous
- 5,000 installations = 25 TW continuous
- **That's more than current total human energy use—from pure solar**

**The Transition Path:**
1. **First 100 structures** → Demonstrate feasibility, power their own construction
2. **Next 900 structures** → Replace global fossil fuel electricity generation
3. **Next 4,000 structures** → Replace ALL fossil fuels (transport, heating, industrial)
4. **Surplus energy** → Planetary healing (carbon capture, ocean cleanup, atmospheric restoration)

**Species Example Principle:**
If Earth-based intelligent life cannot transition from extraction to sustainable cycles, we have no business claiming sentience. ERES is humanity's final exam:
- Can we measure precisely enough to avoid harm?
- Can we coordinate at planetary scale?
- Can we build structures that enhance rather than degrade biosphere health?
- **Can we prove that technological civilization is compatible with planetary health?**

If we succeed, we become the proof for the universe that intelligence can be sustainable. If we fail, we're just another extinction event.

### Storm Parties: Political Mobilization for Mega-Structure Deployment

**Traditional politics cannot move fast enough.** Climate bills take decades to pass and implement. We need a new political framework built for emergency response speed.

**Storm Party Structure:**
- **Local chapters** organize around each planned GSSG installation site
- **Platform:** Climate-resilient infrastructure NOW, not 2050 targets
- **Funding model:** Redirect military spending + fossil fuel subsidies to solar mega-structures
- **Timeline:** First installation groundbreaking within 6 months of electoral victory

**Why "Storm Party"?**
Because we're building the infrastructure to survive the storms—literal hurricanes, geomagnetic storms, climate disruption storms—and we're doing it with the urgency of people who see the storm approaching.

**Electoral Strategy:**
Not left vs. right. **Survival vs. extinction.**
- Red districts: "Energy independence, jobs, infrastructure"
- Blue districts: "Climate action, justice, coordination"
- Everyone: "Protection for your family when the next superstorm hits"

### Vacationomics: Making Mega-Structure Construction Desirable

**The Problem with Traditional Infrastructure:**
Massive construction projects = exploitation of labor + environmental destruction

**The ERES Solution:**
Make mega-structure construction sites into **destination experiences** that people pay to participate in.

**Vacationomics Model:**
- Each GSSG installation is also a luxury eco-resort during construction
- Tourists pay premium rates to:
  - Participate in solar furnace operation (witnessing sand fused into structure)
  - Learn bio-energetic measurement techniques
  - Experience living in completed sections while more is built
  - Contribute to species preservation efforts (hands-on conservation)
  
**Economic Reality:**
- Traditional construction: Pay workers to suffer in harsh conditions
- Vacationomics: Tourists pay YOU while learning cutting-edge sustainability tech
- **Result:** Construction becomes net-positive revenue generator

**The Experience Economy Meets Planetary Salvation:**
- "I helped build the structure that saved civilization" > "I went to Disney World"
- Influencer culture mobilizes around GSSG construction documentation
- Educational institutions bring students for experiential learning
- **Mass participation creates political immunity** (millions of people invested in success)

**Measurement Standards for Vacationomics:**
- Participant safety metrics (zero tolerance for accidents)
- Educational outcome verification (people leave genuinely skilled)
- Bio-energetic impact of increased human presence (must remain net-positive)
- Economic sustainability (must remain profitable to ensure continuation)

### The Careful Measurement Imperative

**At planetary scale, small errors cascade into catastrophes.** ERES survives or fails on measurement precision.

**What Must Be Measured:**
1. **Energy flows** - Every joule tracked from solar capture to final use
2. **Material flows** - Every ton of sand, water, biomass accounted for
3. **Bio-energetic health** - Real-time BERA monitoring of ecosystem vitality
4. **Magnetic field interactions** - Are our structures affecting planetary magnetism?
5. **Atmospheric chemistry** - Continuous air quality and composition tracking
6. **Species vitality** - Population health in preserved ecosystems
7. **Human wellbeing** - Physical and psychological health of participants
8. **Structural integrity** - Real-time stress/strain monitoring of all installations

**VERTECA Verification Standards:**
- All measurements triple-redundant (BERA + traditional sensors + human observation)
- Public dashboards (anyone can verify our claims in real-time)
- Automated shutdown if any metric crosses safety threshold
- **No compromises on measurement accuracy—ever**

**The Scale Challenge:**
Managing 1,000+ installations generating petabytes of measurement data requires:
- GSSG coordination infrastructure
- AI systems trained on ERES principles (not profit maximization)
- Human oversight maintaining ethical boundaries
- Continuous calibration against planetary health outcomes

**Why This Matters:**
If we cannot measure precisely, we cannot build safely. If we cannot build safely, we'll make Earth's crises worse. The measurement infrastructure is as critical as the structures themselves.

### The Dual-Strategy Architecture

**PRIMARY: Planetary Correction**
- Deploy massive solar energy collection + bio-energetic measurement systems
- Use Earth's own centrifugal forces strategically to counter magnetic drift
- Network of coordinated Smart Cities measuring and responding to planetary health
- BERA-SAT (Bio-Energetic Resonance Architecture - Satellite) monitoring system
- Real-time planetary health dashboard with early warning systems

**CONTINGENCY: Planetary Protection**
- Same infrastructure pivots to survival mode if correction proves insufficient
- Self-sustaining biosphere domes preserve genetic diversity
- Distributed network ensures no single-point failure
- Human civilization continuity through potential extreme events
- 1000-year planning horizon for genuine resilience

### Why This Works Where Others Fail

**1. Systems Integration**
ERES frameworks treat Earth as the integrated system it is:
- **GSSG:** Coordinates energy, data, and resources globally
- **PlayNAC:** Governance for distributed decision-making at scale
- **BERA:** Bio-energetic measurement for real-time planetary health monitoring
- **PBJ Tri-Codex:** Environmental metrics that track system health, not isolated variables
- **VERTECA:** Verification ensuring system integrity and preventing corruption

**2. Economic Alignment**
- **UBIMIA (Universal Basic Income + Meritocracy):** Funds global participation
- **Meritcoin/GraceChain:** Economic systems rewarding conservation and coordination
- **Resource allocation based on planetary need, not national boundaries**

**3. Scalable Deployment**
- Start with pilot regions (e.g., Puerto Rico, Iceland)
- Prove concept at regional scale
- Expand to continental coordination
- Full planetary integration by 2035-2040

**4. Measurable Outcomes**
- Real-time bio-energetic monitoring
- Quantified species protection metrics
- Magnetic field monitoring integration
- Clear threshold indicators for correction vs. protection mode activation

- Integration with NOAA/ESA magnetic field tracking

### Long-Term (3-10 Years)

**Phase 2 - Coordinated Network:**
- 50-100 installations forming functional planetary grid
- Complete fossil fuel replacement for electricity generation (first milestone)
- Mobile structure prototypes (ability to relocate in response to climate events)
- GSSG energy sharing eliminates grid vulnerabilities (distributed resilience)
- Storm Party majority governments in 20+ regions → legal authority for planetary coordination
- International standards (ISO frameworks) mandate ERES verification for all large-scale construction

**Phase 3 - Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Complete (Years 10-30):**
- 500-1,000 installations operational
- **All fossil fuel energy replaced by solar mega-structure network**

- Biodiversity metrics: Net positive (more species thriving than before industrial era)
- Magnetic field correction: Measurable impact from coordinated bio-energetic structures
- **Proof of concept complete:** Intelligence CAN coordinate at planetary scale

**Phase 5 - Space Capability (Years 50-100):**
- Tetrahedral structures retrofitted for orbital capability
- Self-sustaining biosphere modules can achieve escape velocity if needed
- Not abandoning Earth—creating insurance policy
- **Ultimate success metric:** We DON'T need to leave because we fixed the planet
- But if we do need to leave (asteroid, solar event, unforeseen catastrophe), we can

### The 1000-Year Vision

**Years 100-1000:**
- Earth maintained as permanent biosphere sanctuary
- GSSG installations continuously upgraded with advancing technology
- Human civilization expands beyond Earth while maintaining planetary health
- Species preservation: All genetic diversity protected indefinitely
- **Legacy:** Earth as the proof that technological intelligence can be regenerative, not destructive

**The Measure of Success:**
In year 1000, descendants look back and say:
*"In 2026, they saw the warning signs and built the infrastructure that saved everything."*

Not: "They had the knowledge but lacked the will."

---

## THE CHOICE

We stand at a unique moment in Earth's 4.5-billion-year history:

**For the first time, a species has both:**
1. The **capacity** to cause planetary-scale disruption
2. The **technology** to measure and respond to that disruption in real-time
3. The **knowledge** to coordinate planetary-scale solutions
4. The **responsibility** to prove technological intelligence can be sustainable

But this window closes rapidly. The South Atlantic Anomaly grows 8% annually. Habitat destruction continues. Climate feedbacks accelerate.

### The Species Example Imperative

**This is not just about human survival.**

This is about whether **intelligence itself** is compatible with planetary health.

Somewhere in the universe, other species may be watching. Or will emerge millions of years from now and find our fossil record. They will ask:

*"Did they coordinate before collapse? Did they measure carefully? Did they transition from extraction to regeneration? Did they prove that a technological civilization can enhance rather than destroy its biosphere?"*

**We are writing the instruction manual for planetary-scale coordination.**

If we succeed:
- We prove intelligence can be regenerative
- We demonstrate measurement precision at planetary scale
- We show how to transition from fossil fuels to pure solar
- We document every step so others can learn from our success

If we fail:
- We prove intelligence is self-terminating
- We demonstrate that technological capability without coordination = extinction
- We leave a cautionary tale in the geological record
- **We waste the 4.5 billion years it took for Earth to produce a species capable of understanding these principles**

**This is why careful measurement matters so critically.**

We cannot afford to:
- Build structures that disrupt ecosystems (BERA must verify bio-energetic health)
- Deploy energy systems that create new problems (every joule must be solar-sourced)
- Move sand without tracking ecological impact (VERTECA verification required)
- Scale without precision (small errors at planetary scale = catastrophic failures)

**The mathematics must be perfect. The measurement must be rigorous. The coordination must be flawless.**

Not because we're perfectionists. Because physics demands it.

**Species maturity means recognizing that our survival depends on precision, not hope.**

---

### Two Pathways Forward

**PATH 1: Continue Current Approach**
- Fragmented national responses
- Individual crisis management
- Hope that uncoordinated efforts somehow converge
- Fossil fuel dependency persists for decades
- **Result:** Cascading systems failure, 20-50% species loss by 2100 (Nature, 2022), civilization disruption

**PATH 2: Deploy Integrated Planetary Infrastructure**
- ERES frameworks provide tested coordination architecture
- GSSG mega-structures replace fossil fuels with pure solar within 30 years
- Smart Cities preserve and measure ecosystem health in real-time
- Coordinated response to interconnected crises
- **Result:** Species preservation, civilization continuity, proof that intelligence can be regenerative

**The mathematics favors PATH 2.**  
**The physics demands PATH 2.**  
**The species responsibility requires PATH 2.**

---

## CALL TO ACTION

**To World Leaders:** This is not about climate targets in 2050. This is about deploying tested infrastructure now to prevent total systems collapse.

**To Scientific Community:** The frameworks exist in published, peer-reviewed formats (300+ papers on ResearchGate, production code on GitHub). Review, validate, improve—but DO NOT let perfect be the enemy of functional.

**To Philanthropists & Private Sector:** The first Smart City/Nature Dome pilot requires $2-5 billion. This is less than the cost of a single failed military program. ROI is measured in civilization continuity.

**To The Public:** Demand that your governments participate in coordinated planetary infrastructure. The Storm Party framework provides political vehicle for rapid deployment.

**To Future Generations:** We write this so you'll know we saw the warning signs, had the capability to respond, and—we hope—chose to act while there was still time.

---

## CONCLUSION: WE HAVE THE SAND, THE SUN, AND THE MATHEMATICS

The ERES Institute stands ready to:

1. **Begin construction immediately** - Solar furnace prototype operational within 60 days
2. **Document every measurement** - Transparent public verification of all claims
3. **Prove the economics** - First installation achieves profitability within 2 years
4. **Scale exponentially** - Each structure powers construction of the next faster
5. **Open-source everything** - All frameworks, all mathematics, all engineering specs
6. **Maintain 1000-year perspective** - While acting with immediate urgency

### The Engineering Is Ready

- **Sand**: Unlimited supply in desert regions
- **Solar**: 6,800x more energy hitting Earth than we need
- **Technology**: Concentrated solar furnaces can fuse sand into mega-structures TODAY
- **Coordination**: GSSG architecture provides real-time planetary grid management
- **Verification**: BERA + VERTECA ensure measurement accuracy at every scale
- **Economics**: Vacationomics makes construction profitable instead of subsidized
- **Politics**: Storm Party provides rapid-deployment legal framework

### The Species Responsibility

If humanity—with all our technological capability—cannot transition from extraction to sustainability, we have no business claiming intelligence.

**We are being tested.**

Not by a divine force. By physics, chemistry, and biology. The same laws that created us will destroy us if we fail to coordinate at the scale our technology demands.

**But we can pass this test.**

- Ancient civilizations built pyramids with manual labor and no machines
- We have solar-powered robotics, real-time global communication, and unlimited energy
- **We can build 1,000 mega-structures faster than Egypt built one pyramid**

The question is not capability. It's will.

### The Alarm Is Sounding

- South Atlantic Anomaly growing 8% annually
- 40,000 species threatened with extinction
- Habitat destruction accelerating
- Climate feedbacks amplifying
- **The window for coordinated response is measured in years, not decades**

### What We're NOT Asking For

- We're NOT asking for research grants to study feasibility (it's feasible NOW)
- We're NOT asking for another UN committee to debate (engineering teams can start TODAY)
- We're NOT asking permission to save the world (we're offering proven solutions)

### What We ARE Demanding

**DEPLOYMENT AUTHORITY**

Give ERES the legal framework and initial funding to:
1. Break ground on first GSSG installation within 90 days
2. Demonstrate complete solar-powered construction cycle within 1 year
3. Prove economic viability within 2 years
4. Scale to 100 installations within 10 years

**That's it.**

After that, the installations fund themselves. Energy sales + Vacationomics + ecosystem services = profitable regenerative infrastructure.

### The Choice Before Us

**PATH 1: Continue Current Approach**
- Fragmented national responses
- Fossil fuel dependency continuing
- Individual species conservation efforts
- Hope that uncoordinated actions somehow work
- **Result:** Cascading systems failure, 20-50% species loss, civilization disruption

**PATH 2: Deploy ERES Mega-Structures**
- Integrated planetary infrastructure
- 100% solar energy within 30 years
- Coordinated species preservation
- Careful measurement ensuring we're helping, not harming
- **Result:** Sustainable technological civilization, biodiversity restoration, species maturity proven

### The Final Word

**We are not asking permission to save the world.**  
**We are sounding the alarm and offering tested solutions.**  
**We have the sand, the sun, and the mathematics.**  
**We have 300+ published papers documenting every detail.**  
**We have production code ready to deploy.**  

**The choice to act belongs to all of us.**

But understand this: **Every day we delay, the task becomes harder.**

The South Atlantic Anomaly doesn't wait for political consensus.  
Species extinction doesn't pause for budget discussions.  
Climate feedbacks don't care about election cycles.

**Physics is indifferent to our hesitation.**

**We can coordinate at planetary scale, or we can experience planetary-scale failure.**

**Those are the only two options.**

ERES chooses coordination.

What will you choose?
