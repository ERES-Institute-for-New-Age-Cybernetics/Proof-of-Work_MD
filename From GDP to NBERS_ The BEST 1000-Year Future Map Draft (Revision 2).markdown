# **From GDP to NBERS: The BEST 1000-Year Future Map Draft (Revision 2)**

## **Abstract**

This paper proposes replacing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with the National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (NBERS) to measure prosperity through ecological health, social equity, and human well-being. It outlines a 1,000-year roadmap for a Bio-Ecologic Economy, integrating biometric accountability, empirical feedback, and intergenerational stewardship. Key components include Emotional Personal IQ Real and Quantum (EPIR-Q), Aura Resonance Index (ARI), Sovereign Universal Glycan Architecture for Resilience (SUGAR), EarnedPath (EP), Bio-Electric Signature Time (BEST), and FAVORS (Fingerprint, Aura, Voice, Retina, Signature). These are supported by governance models (CBGMODD, P³), learning systems (Empirical Realtime Education System, PlayNAC), and certification protocols (TETRA CERT). The framework shifts value from resource extraction to health, law, protection, and sustainable prosperity.

## **1. Introduction**

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures economic output but overlooks ecological degradation, health disparities, and social inequities. By prioritizing consumption, it incentivizes unsustainable practices. This paper introduces the Bio-Ecologic Economy, centered on the National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (NBERS), which quantifies ecological balance, societal well-being, and resilience. Developed by the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics, this framework integrates biometric, cybernetic, and governance systems to ensure long-term human and planetary survival.

## **2. Core Components**

### **2.1 Emotional Personal IQ Real and Quantum (EPIR-Q)**

EPIR-Q quantifies intelligence across personal, social, and ecological dimensions, incorporating empathy, trust, and responsibility. It uses a formula: **P³ (Personal, Public, Private) × Artificial Intelligence + Sustainability**. For example, a community leader’s decisions are scored based on their impact on individual well-being (Personal), community trust (Public), and institutional accountability (Private), enhanced by AI-driven analytics and sustainability metrics.

### **2.2 Aura Resonance Index (ARI)**

ARI measures the alignment of human actions with social and ecological systems using biometric data (e.g., heart rate variability, electrodermal responses). It evaluates the clarity and impact of an individual’s influence. For instance, a farmer adopting regenerative practices would score higher on ARI due to positive ecological resonance. EPIR-Q and ARI together link intent to measurable outcomes.

### **2.3 Sovereign Universal Glycan Architecture for Resilience (SUGAR)**

SUGAR is the biochemical and cybernetic foundation for sustainability:
- **Biological Core**: Leverages glycobiology (e.g., glycan chains in metabolism and immunity) to support personalized medicine and ecological health.
- **Cybernetic Layer**: Uses programmable protocols to integrate health data with legal frameworks, equating laws to enforceable “walls” (e.g., regulations preventing deforestation).
- **Distributed Systems**: Employs local renewable energy grids, semantic AI, and community-led factories to scale solutions.
- **Role**: Anchors wellness metrics (PERC, BERC, JERC, NBERS) and supports ecological defense, such as soil restoration projects.

### **2.4 National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (NBERS)**

NBERS replaces GDP by measuring ecological health (e.g., biodiversity, carbon levels), social equity (e.g., access to education), and human wellness (e.g., mental health indices). It drives a **99/1 CARE Economy**, where 99% of resources prioritize collective well-being over the 1% focused on profit-driven extraction. For example, a nation’s NBERS score improves with investments in renewable energy and universal healthcare.

### **2.5 Citizen, Business, Government, Military, Ombudsman, Dignitary, Diplomat (CBGMODD) and P³**

CBGMODD is a governance model ensuring accountability across stakeholders. It operates within the P³ framework (Personal, Public, Private), where decisions are traced through individual actions, societal oversight, and institutional responsibility. For instance, a policy to reduce emissions requires personal compliance (e.g., reduced car use), public monitoring (e.g., community audits), and private enforcement (e.g., corporate penalties).

### **2.6 FAVORS: Fingerprint, Aura, Voice, Retina, Signature**

FAVORS secures identity through layered biometrics:
- **Function**: Ensures participation in economic and civic systems is tied to verified individuals, preventing fraud.
- **Sustainability**: Links resource access to ecological contributions, e.g., higher NBERS scores unlock benefits.
- **Governance**: Integrates with CBGMODD and P³ to enforce accountability, such as verifying votes or transactions.
- **Example**: A citizen’s biometric profile ensures their carbon footprint is tracked, rewarding low-impact behaviors.

### **2.7 Bio-Electric Signature Time (BEST)**

BEST uses time-bound biometric signatures to verify participation in transactions (e.g., Biometric Checkout for purchases) and civic duties (e.g., voting). It records contributions’ timing and impact, linking actions to long-term ecological outcomes. For example, volunteering for reforestation earns BEST credits, redeemable for community benefits.

### **2.8 EarnedPath (EP)**

EarnedPath tracks contributions (e.g., ecological restoration, education) to assign merit-based access to resources. Integrated with PlayNAC and ERES EP, it ensures learning and accountability are linked. For instance, completing a sustainability course via ERES EP increases EP credits, unlocking access to advanced training.

## **3. Learning, Simulation, and Certification**

### **3.1 Empirical Realtime Education System (ERES EP)**

ERES EP delivers adaptive education using biometric and resonance data (e.g., ARI) to align learning with ecological and social goals. For example, a student studying water conservation receives real-time feedback on their project’s impact, fostering practical skills and accountability.

### **3.2 PlayNAC: New Age Cybernetic Game Theory**

PlayNAC is a simulation platform where individuals and institutions test decisions using EPIR-Q, ARI, BEST, and NBERS. It rewards alignment with sustainability goals and offers remediation for missteps. For example, a city planner simulates a new transit system to optimize NBERS scores before implementation.

### **3.3 TETRA CERT Framework**

TETRA CERT validates contributions across four domains:
- **Education → Health**: Certifies training in wellness (e.g., nutrition courses).
- **Desire → Law**: Aligns ambitions with legal frameworks (e.g., ethical business practices).
- **SPRT → Protection and Skills-Trade**: Verifies skills in ecological defense and mediation.
- **Certification → Accountability**: Ensures transparent, trusted contributions, such as verified carbon offsets.

## **4. Implementation Phases**

### **4.1 Foundation (Years 0–200)**

- **Goals**: Establish EPIR-Q, ARI, FAVORS, BEST, and EarnedPath baselines; deploy SUGAR in pilot regions (e.g., urban micro-grids); launch ERES EP and PlayNAC; shift national policies toward NBERS.
- **Example**: A pilot city implements NBERS to prioritize green infrastructure, funded by redirecting GDP-based subsidies.

### **4.2 Expansion (Years 200–600)**

- **Goals**: Scale SUGAR globally (e.g., renewable energy networks); institutionalize CBGMODD with FAVORS verification; expand Biometric Checkout and EarnedPath; use NBERS for trade and resource allocation.
- **Example**: Countries adopt NBERS-based trade agreements, prioritizing low-carbon goods.

### **4.3 Flourish (Years 600–1000)**

- **Goals**: Achieve global resonance between individuals, societies, and ecosystems; constitutionalize NBERS; extend governance to space exploration; prioritize wellness and stewardship.
- **Example**: Orbital colonies use NBERS to allocate resources, ensuring ecological balance.

## **5. Conclusion**

The shift from GDP to NBERS reorients civilization toward sustainability and equity. EPIR-Q and ARI provide feedback, SUGAR builds infrastructure, EarnedPath tracks merit, BEST and FAVORS ensure accountability, NBERS measures prosperity, and TETRA CERT enforces standards. This BEST 1000-Year Future Map offers a practical yet visionary path to human and planetary flourishing.
